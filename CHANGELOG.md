    ### Reverts

    - **Revert "fix(provider-state): senior-review follow-ups" (commit `a524329`, reverted in `9b7f84d`)**: The senior-review-fix commit landed with a commit message and changelog entry that described fixes it did the opposite of — the diff was a silent, near-total revert of the entire `context-os-evidence-execution-repair` series (typed EvidencePack prompt governance, EvidenceResolver single-canonical retrieval, explicit source-switch handling, clarification short-circuit, producer-metadata embedding plumbing, Groq/OpenAI model-id ordering, IPv6 / numeric SSRF guards, FK cascade test coverage). It also deleted a previously-passing regression test (`KnowledgeIngestSpaceMetadata.test.mjs`) and rewrote a surviving test (`EmbeddingFallbackSinglePath.test.mjs`) to assert the regressed behavior, while claiming "71/71 focused tests pass". A post-merge `code-reviewer` pass caught the contradiction (7 CRITICAL, 2 HIGH) and recommended **BLOCK**. Reverting restores the parent `97daeba` state where every claimed-but-not-shipped feature already lives: `EmbeddingPipeline.getEmbeddingWithFallback()` returns producer metadata; `main.ts` wires the orchestrator through the metadata-returning path; `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` is enabled unconditionally on the shared connection; the FK cascade suite covers the full `mode_reference_files → knowledge_sources → knowledge_packs → knowledge_cards + entities/relations/index_versions` chain and bare `deleteMode`; `ipcHandlers.modelAvailable` matches Groq (`llama-`/`mixtral-`/`gemma-`/`meta-llama/`/`qwen/` + Groq-hosted `openai/gpt-oss-`) before the broad `includes('openai')` catch-all; `validateUrlForSsrf` blocks `::1`, `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10`, and pure-numeric / `0x`-prefixed hostnames that some stacks silently re-interpret as `127.0.0.1` after DNS canonicalization; the Context OS H1 typed-EvidencePack path, EvidenceResolver single-canonical retrieval, explicit-source-switch resolution (`resolveExplicitSourceRequest` / `toLegacyUserExplicitSource`), and the `sourceOwner='clarify'` short-circuit that logs the exact `finalAction` (not a hardcoded `'answer'`) are all present. This revert commit has no other intent.

    ### What's New

    - **Opt-in native OOM evidence capture for launcher startup investigations**: Adds `NATIVELY_NATIVE_OOM_TRACE=1`, an inert-by-default local diagnostic session that writes a capped 5 MB NDJSON trace under `userData/diagnostics/`. The trace uses an allowlist-only schema: it records process memory, launcher process identity, OS memory totals, BrowserWindow lifecycle markers, and aggregate outbound IPC channel counts/estimated byte sizes — never message payloads, transcripts, prompts, URLs, credentials, screenshots, or tokens. `NATIVELY_NATIVE_OOM_CONTENT_TRACE=1` additionally captures one bounded 25-second Chromium trace after launcher load, scoped to the main and launcher renderer processes with Chromium argument filtering enabled. Launcher `render-process-gone`, window-close, and quit paths stop the content trace safely. Adds development-only `NATIVELY_LAUNCHER_ISOLATION=shell|global-surfaces` controls for controlled Windows/macOS bisection without changing packaged behavior: `shell` isolates the Electron/preload shell before React mounts; `global-surfaces` retains the launcher while excluding root-level banners, toasters, prompts, and promos. Six focused privacy/lifecycle tests cover disabled behavior, payload exclusion, IPC aggregation, disk cap, and content-trace gating/idempotency.

    - **Context OS document-grounding benchmark, evidence execution, and retrieval hardening**: Added a parser-faithful 200-question real-PDF benchmark harness with a fixed 140-development / 30-validation / 30-sealed-holdout protocol, production Electron manual-chat lifecycle, safe benchmark audit/prompt-audit artifacts, deterministic scorer, and a distinct-invocation MiniMax-M3 semantic judge tier that upgrades wording-equivalent answers without overriding deterministic hard failures. Context OS now governs document-structure turns through one canonical typed `EvidencePack` and fixes three structural retrieval failures: ToC navigation confidence now retains the answerability signal (preventing false insufficient-evidence refusals), low-confidence/rerank gating uses that same positive answerability score (preventing a headless reranker stall), and leaderless Chapter 1 ToC entries are retained. Added structural-answer routing (`document_structure_answer`), ToC promotion only for structural questions, targeted section restoration before admission-floor loss, space-aligned PDF table row preservation, and OKF distinctive-term/IDF scoring so entity-parent cards do not silently hide a more-specific section. Removed pre-existing thesis-specific Mercury/Jetson/ESP32 controller ranking rules and added a production-source no-benchmark-leak guard. Final no-hardcode live development run: 104/140 deterministic (74.3%), 109/140 two-tier (77.9%), 140/140 lineage valid, 0 contamination, structure 8/8; validation and sealed holdout remain intentionally unrun pending the development gate. Full artifact report: `docs/context-os/200q-real-backend/BENCHMARK_REPORT_2026-07-13.md`.

    - **Provider state-awareness — runtime ladders stop lying after credential removal**: Fixes the class of failures where the LLM/RAG/Settings stack continued to consult a provider whose key had just been cleared, producing wasted cloud calls (`403 PERMISSION_DENIED` from a deleted Gemini key), Codex "Not signed in" errors after OAuth sign-out, stale Settings dropdowns still showing the deleted default model, and embedding pipelines stuck on a stale cloud provider instead of degrading to Ollama/local. Five interlocking changes close each leak: (1) `LLMHelper.setApiKey/setGroqApiKey/setOpenaiApiKey/setClaudeApiKey` now null the in-memory client (and reset health/local-disable state) on an empty key, so every `Boolean(this.client)` / `Boolean(this.openaiClient)` gate becomes truthful the moment the user removes the key in Settings — `switchToGemini('')` no longer constructs `new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: '' })`; (2) Codex is now gated through a single OAuth-aware helper `isCodexAvailable()` that requires `codexCliConfig.enabled` **and** `CodexOAuthService.getStatus().signedIn === true`, used at every structured-generation / direct-call / streaming / routeWithScopeFallback site; both Codex sign-out paths (`codex-cli:logout` and `codex:sign-out`) now broadcast `credentials-changed` and refresh a stale default model, so Codex disappears from Settings immediately on ChatGPT sign-out; (3) the embedding pipeline's change detector is bidirectional (`_isConfigChanged` now compares normalized prev vs next for `openaiKey`, `geminiKey`, `ollamaUrl`, the Gemini key-pool, model dims, data scopes, and `explicitKeyManagement`), so removing a key re-resolves the provider instead of silently keeping the previous cloud instance until restart — and Settings-triggered reinitialization passes `explicitKeyManagement: true`, which makes `EmbeddingProviderResolver.buildGeminiKeyPool` skip `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY(_2.._6)/GOOGLE_API_KEY` so a cleared UI key can never be resurrected from the environment; (4) `getEmbedding()` and `getEmbeddingForQuery()` now fallback-and-promote to the local provider on primary failure (mirroring what batch embedding already did), persist `last_embedding_space`, and emit `embedding:space-persist-failed` if persistence fails — so JD/resume/reference-file ingestion and live query embeddings degrade to bundled local embeddings instead of storing unembedded nodes or lexical-only rows; (5) embedding auth failures now carry `permanentAuthFailure` + status + body, Gemini marks the offending key auth-dead and rotates within the pool while 429s remain bounded cooldowns, OpenAI's `embed/embedBatch` classify 401/403 as permanent, and `probeAvailable` short-circuits on permanent auth (no three-try hysteresis on a dead key). `src/components/settings/AIProvidersSettings.tsx` now subscribes to `onCredentialsChanged` and reloads credentials/default-model state on every IPC credential change, includes Codex only when `codexOauthStatus.signedIn && codexCliConfig.enabled` (the legacy `signedIn || enabled` is gone), stops re-inserting an unavailable `defaultModel` into the dropdown, clears LiteLLM runtime model + base URL + max-tokens form fields when another window removes the proxy, and resolves an unavailable runtime default to a safe ladder (Natively → cloud-by-key → signed-in Codex → LiteLLM-discovered → custom → Ollama → `natively`, never keyless Gemini). Live meeting indexing now embeds each live tick as one coherent batch via `getEmbeddingsWithFallback()`, so a primary→local promotion cannot store early chunks in the old cloud space while stamping the meeting with the new local space; `electron/rag/__tests__/LiveRAGIndexerSpacePromotion.test.mjs` proves every stored live chunk remains searchable under the stamped space. Five new focused regression suites: `electron/services/__tests__/ProviderStateAwareness.test.mjs` (LLMHelper setter empty-key clearing, switchToGemini empty-key delegation, Codex OAuth gating on every ladder, `codex-cli:logout` + `codex:sign-out` broadcast, all 7 IPC credential handlers refresh + broadcast), `electron/services/__tests__/AIProvidersSettingsState.test.mjs` (settings subscribes to `credentials-changed`, Codex requires signedIn+enabled, unavailable default is not re-inserted, LiteLLM models load/clear on proxy presence), `electron/rag/__tests__/EmbeddingConfigStateAwareness.test.mjs` (`_isConfigChanged` is removal-aware, `_isConfigImprovement` no longer survives, `explicitKeyManagement` plumbs through RAGManager → EmbeddingPipeline.initialize, Settings handlers do not OR removed keys with env vars), `electron/rag/__tests__/EmbeddingFallbackSinglePath.test.mjs` (`getEmbedding` and `getEmbeddingForQuery` fallback to `fallbackProvider`, promote it on success, persist `last_embedding_space`), and `electron/rag/__tests__/EmbeddingProviderAuthClassify.test.mjs` (Gemini 403 marks key auth-dead and rotates within pool; 429 stays a cooldown; OpenAI 401/403 carry `permanentAuthFailure`+status+body; resolver `probeAvailable` does not retry on permanent auth). 40/40 focused provider-state tests pass; `npm run typecheck:electron` and `npm run build:electron` clean.

    - **Undetectable mode: Dock icon no longer leaks after "Stop meeting" (macOS)**: Fixes the intermittent stealth failure where, with undetectable mode ON, starting a meeting then pressing **Stop** *sometimes* revealed the Natively Dock tile. Root cause: `endMeeting()` swaps the visible window overlay→launcher via `WindowHelper.switchToLauncher()`, which does `launcherWindow.show()` + `.focus()`. The launcher is a **regular** macOS window (no `type: 'panel'`, no `skipTaskbar` — unlike the overlay NSPanel), so the activating show re-activates the app as a foreground app; macOS re-registers it and re-shows the Dock tile that `app.dock.hide()` had suppressed, with nothing re-asserting stealth afterward. It was intermittent because macOS asynchronously coalesces and sometimes drops dock/activation-policy calls, so whether the tile stuck depended on timing. Fixed at the single choke point every launcher show funnels through: `switchToLauncher()` now calls a new `AppState.reassertUndetectableStealth()` (gated on `darwin` + `getUndetectable()`) **after** the show, which drives the same self-verifying `_enforceDockState()` loop the toggle path uses — it polls `app.dock.isVisible()` (the OS ground truth) and re-applies `dock.hide()` + content protection until reality matches intent, so a dropped or late dock op cannot defeat it. The pre-existing startup convergence (`applyInitialUndetectableState()`) now delegates to the same hardened method, and `reassertUndetectableStealth()` clears any in-flight enforcement timers before starting so bursty Stop→Start→Stop cycles don't stack redundant loops. The one launcher-show that bypasses `switchToLauncher()` — the `settings:open-tab` IPC handler — was also closed: its undetectable arm keeps the non-activating `showInactive()` **and** now re-asserts stealth, so no launcher-show path can leak the tile. New regression suite `electron/audio/__tests__/UndetectableDockLeakOnLauncherShow.test.mjs` (source-contract guards that fail against the pre-fix source + a behavioral convergence model proving the loop reaches "dock hidden" even when the OS drops the first `hide()`); 63/63 across the stealth/dock/meeting/window/screenshot suites, typecheck clean.

    - **JD / Resume JIT pipeline — job-description questions now reach the prompt**: Fixes the class of failures where a question about the *target role* ("what does this role require?", "what are the top skills for this JD?", "does the JD mention salary?") silently dropped the job-description before any prompt was built, so the model answered blind or said it "didn't have the JD". The active JD was always stored, structured, and fresh — the answer classifier simply never routed it. Six new **JD-source answer shapes** are added to `AnswerPlanner`: JD-only (`jd_summary_answer`, `jd_requirements_answer`, `jd_fact_answer`, source-owner `profile_jd`, `jd` layer primary) and resume+JD (`resume_jd_fit_answer`, `resume_jd_gap_answer`, `resume_jd_intro_answer`, source-owner `mixed`, both `resume`+`jd` layers). Routing is driven by a conservative `resolveJdSourceType` resolver placed *early* in the classify chain (before the negotiation/identity/skills/unknown branches that used to swallow these), keyed off **generalized shape cues** — a JD-reference cue (this JD / the role / job description / they require) versus a first-person candidate cue (my / I / should I) — never off any specific JD title, company, project name, or benchmark string. It defers to the proven `JD_FIT_PATTERNS` / `GAP_PATTERNS` branches wherever they already route resume+jd, so only genuinely missed or mis-routed shapes are claimed. Concretely: "tell me about yourself **for this role**" / "walk me through my resume **with this JD in mind**" stop collapsing to `identity_answer` (which forbade jd); "how would you explain your **lack of experience** in the JD requirements" stops collapsing to `technical_concept_answer`; "most relevant **project/internship for this JD**" stops dropping the jd layer; "skills **required for this role**" stops forbidding jd.

    - **Full source-tagged JD evidence in the JIT prompt**: `selectManualProfileEvidence` now emits the *whole* structured JD — requirements, responsibilities, technologies, keywords, nice-to-haves, level, employment type, min-years, summary (source-tagged `profile_jd`, capped) — not just title/company. `ProfileJitPromptBuilder` renders JD and resume evidence in **separate labelled blocks** (`<target_job_evidence>` / `<candidate_resume_evidence>`) with an explicit `<source_separation_rules>` block: a JD requirement may never be presented as the candidate's claimed experience, and a JD requirement the resume doesn't show is a *gap*, never fabricated. JD-fact questions with an absent field (salary/relocation) answer honestly — "the JD does not specify that" — and never ask the user to upload a JD that is already loaded, and never pivot to salary negotiation unless the user explicitly asks how to negotiate.

    - **Honest evidence diagnostics ("layers selected" ≠ "evidence present")**: The misleading `structured_jd_used = Boolean(jd) && layers.includes('jd')` is replaced by `jdEvidenceCount > 0`, measured from the source-tagged `EvidenceItem`s that actually rendered into the prompt. A new per-answer diagnostic object carries `activeJDId/Hash`, `activeResumeId/Hash`, `jdEvidenceCount`, `resumeEvidenceCount`, `hasProfileJDBlock`, `renderedEvidenceSourceTypes`, `exactQuestionIncluded`, `finalGenerationMode`, and `providerActuallyDispatched`. A new canonical `electron/llm/ActiveProfileContext.ts` read-model supplies the provenance (sourceId + content hash) so a JD question can be reconciled end-to-end.

    - **Full-JIT law enforced — AOT prepares evidence, the provider writes every answer**: New `jitFinalAnswerEnforced` feature flag (default ON). The AOT-precomputed intro/identity string is no longer emitted verbatim as the final answer at either `LLMHelper` site (streaming + non-streaming) or via the legacy deterministic profile fast-path in `ipcHandlers`; it is demoted to a `<candidate_identity_fact>` evidence block and the provider generates the user-visible answer just-in-time. The AOT precompute is retained for latency; only the verbatim emit is removed. Bare social greetings ("hi") keep their instant canned reply (a new `isBareGreeting` flag on `PromptAssemblyResult` distinguishes them from factual intros). Flip the flag OFF to restore the legacy fast paths instantly.

    - **Prior-answer contamination containment**: On the manual, non-document-grounded path, candidate/JD answers now wrap the rolling snapshot's prior assistant turns in `<previous_responses trust="low" authority="non_authoritative" purpose="conversation_continuity_only">` so an earlier wrong answer can never re-enter the next prompt as JD/resume evidence — a clean transcript is untouched, and document-grounded strip behavior is unchanged.

    - **Tests & docs**: `electron/llm/__tests__/JdResumeJitPipeline2026_07_07.test.mjs` (37 tests across JD routing, JD evidence, honest absence, resume+JD, resume-only regression, coding regression, telemetry honesty, and an anti-hardcoding mutation block that renames the JD title/technologies, removes salary, renames projects/companies, and paraphrases every question — behavior must hold with zero code change) and `ActiveProfileContext2026_07_07.test.mjs` (6). Read-only verifiers `tools/jd-resume-jit-investigation/verify-jd-{routing,evidence}.mjs` (26/26 + 6/6) drive the real compiled pipeline. Core routing/evidence/policy regression suites stay green (261/261). Full write-up in `docs/JD_RESUME_JIT_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`; policy in `docs/PROFILE_INTELLIGENCE_FULL_JIT_POLICY.md` gains the "JD as target-role source" and "evidence is proof, layers are not" sections.

    - **Skill deletion in Settings → Skills**: User-installed skills (e.g. `code-simplifier`) now have a per-row delete control — hover-reveal Trash2 icon (also revealed on keyboard focus, with a `[@media(hover:none)]:opacity-100` touch-device fallback that always shows the button on non-hover hardware). The hover-reveal animation matches the meeting-notes action-bar idiom at `MeetingDetails.tsx:696` (subtle `translate-y` slide-up + 160 ms `ease-out` reveal) — both consumers share the same animation contract so users see one consistent reveal pattern across settings panels. First click on the trash enters an inline 2-step confirm row (Cancel + red Delete) with Escape-key dismissal, 6-second auto-cancel, and `aria-live="polite"` for screen readers — replacing the original `window.confirm()` system dialog after a senior-review UX audit. Per-skill in-flight tracking via `deletingIds: Set<string>` prevents double-click races. The delete is TOCTOU-safe: `SkillsManager.deleteSkill()` calls `fs.realpathSync` on both the target and `skillsDir` at delete-time, then `fs.rmSync({recursive:true,force:true})` — meaning a symlink-swap between the initial `loadSkills()` read and the delete is closed by the realpath containment check. Sanitized error messages ("Could not delete skill.") — no internal-implementation detail leaks to the renderer banner. Built-in skills (e.g. `humanize-ai-text`) are protected at three layers and have no delete affordance rendered: (1) `skill.source !== 'builtin'` UI gate, (2) `SkillsManager.deleteSkill()` refuses with a clear error if a direct IPC call slips through, (3) `ensureBuiltinSkills()` would silently re-seed the folder anyway. (`76d531b`, `b1e4fc6`, `3950df8` — 1 file, +56/-112 net for the final shape.) See the **Code Review Fixes (2026-07-06)** section below for the senior review findings and the cumulative UX fixes that shaped this.

    - **LiteLLM AI Gateway**: Added LiteLLM as a built-in provider, giving access to 100+ LLM providers (AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, Azure, Cohere, and more) through a single OpenAI-compatible proxy. Configure the proxy URL and optional virtual key under Settings → AI Providers → LiteLLM Proxy; models are auto-discovered from the proxy and listed with a `litellm/` prefix. Max output tokens default to **Auto** — each model's real output budget is read from the proxy's `/model/info` registry (fallback 8,192) — with a manual dropdown override (4K–1M). Routes through the same data-scope gating, rate-limiting, and abort-aware streaming as every other cloud provider.

    - **Native-module architecture guard (four layers)**: Closes the recurring Rosetta-poisoning bug where `better-sqlite3` / `keytar` `.node` binaries got built for `x86_64` on Apple Silicon Macs (silent `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED` → "Local database is DISABLED" at startup). Layer 1: shared `electron/lib/nativeArch.{mjs,cjs}` — single source of truth, hardware-arch via `sysctl hw.optional.arm64` (Rosetta-immune). Layer 2: boot-time gate in `electron/nativeArchGate.ts` — module-load-time synchronous check that throws BEFORE any `init_DatabaseManager()` call, so the failure can no longer happen silently; uncaughtException handler renders a native modal dialog with the platform-correct one-line fix and exits 1. Layer 3: `patches/better-sqlite3+12.11.1.patch` + `patches/keytar+7.9.0.patch` — `patch-package` `preinstall` injection so even `npm rebuild <pkg>` / `npm install <pkg>` flows are guarded (re-applies automatically via the postinstall chain). Layer 4: `.husky/pre-commit` runs `verify-native-arch.js` on every commit (chained with the legacy `react-doctor` + `code-review-graph` hooks, which husky 9 had silently bypassed via `core.hooksPath`); CI gains a `Verify native module architecture` step. Drift guard: `electron/lib/__tests__/nativeArchParity.test.mjs` asserts the cjs/esm shims stay byte-equivalent (caught a real drift on first run). User-facing fix command: `arch -arm64 npm run rebuild:native`. (`15a3838` — 13 files, +973/-81.)

    ### Production launch hardening (2026-07-07) — "stuck at logo" on first start

    Fixes for a production-only failure where new users were stuck on the black launch logo / a "Setting up AI memory… 0%" pill on first start, while dev and the developer's own machine worked. Root-caused from five clean reinstall boot-logs. Dev never reproduced it (no asar; the developer already had Ollama models + a warm ONNX runtime).

    - **ONNX runtime peers were sealed inside the asar** (`package.json` `asarUnpack`). The prior fix unpacked `@huggingface/transformers/**`, but its bare-specifier peer dependencies — `onnxruntime-common`, `onnxruntime-node`, `onnxruntime-web`, and `@huggingface/jinja` — are **hoisted to top-level `node_modules`**, so they stayed packed inside `app.asar` while transformers ran from `app.asar.unpacked`. Node's ESM resolver couldn't cross the boundary, producing the every-boot `Cannot find package 'onnxruntime-common' imported from app.asar.unpacked/.../transformers.node.mjs` and breaking **every** on-device model in production (intent classifier, local embedder, Whisper, reranker). Added the full peer closure to `asarUnpack`. `electron-builder.signed.cjs` inherits it via `{ ...base }`.

    - **Preloaded Model-Selector window `kill -9`'d a healthy Ollama on every boot** (`src/components/ModelSelectorWindow.tsx`). The hidden model-selector preload called `getAvailableOllamaModels()`, and on an empty list ran `forceRestartOllama()` — but an empty list is *also* the state of a perfectly healthy daemon with zero models pulled. New users with Ollama installed but no models had their daemon killed on every launch, which aborted the background `nomic-embed-text` embedding pull mid-stream (`[OllamaBootstrap] Pull failed: terminated`) and left the "Setting up AI memory" pill stuck at 0%. Now gated behind a new `is-ollama-reachable` IPC (`LLMHelper.isOllamaReachable()`, a 1.5 s `/api/tags` liveness probe) so a restart only fires when the daemon is genuinely unreachable — an older preload lacking the method degrades safely to never-restart.

    - **`forceRestartOllama` is now non-destructive for user-managed daemons** (`electron/LLMHelper.ts`, `electron/services/OllamaManager.ts`). Even if some other path calls it, it no longer `kill -9`s a reachable daemon the app didn't spawn: it checks `isOllamaReachable()` + the new `OllamaManager.getIsAppManaged()` and skips the destructive path for a reachable, user-managed Ollama.

    - **Ollama embeddings bootstrap is skipped when a cloud provider is configured** (`electron/main.ts` `bootstrapOllamaEmbeddings`). Pulling the 274 MB `nomic-embed-text` on first launch is pure waste for users with an OpenAI/Gemini key (the RAG pipeline resolves to that cloud provider anyway) and was the thing racing the `kill -9`. Plus an in-memory single-flight guard in `OllamaBootstrap` (a `static inFlight` Set, deliberately **not** persisted so a session killed mid-pull still retries next launch) prevents concurrent pulls; the guard release is inside the `try/finally` so a pre-pull DB error can't wedge it permanently.

    - **Splash can never trap the user** (`src/components/StartupSequence.tsx`). Added a 5 s hard-cap fallback alongside the primary 2.2 s dismiss so the launcher is always revealed even if the primary completion is ever prevented.

    - **Renderer diagnostics now reach the log file** (`electron/WindowHelper.ts`, `src/main.tsx`). The main process logged everything but the renderer logged nothing to `~/Documents/natively_debug.log` — which is exactly why the first three "stuck at logo" logs were silent about the renderer. Added `WindowHelper.attachRendererDiagnostics(win, tag)` (launcher + overlay) capturing `console-message` (warn+error), `render-process-gone` (crash + reason/exitCode), `unresponsive`/`responsive` (hang = "stuck at logo"), `did-finish-load`/`dom-ready` (bundle-evaluated proof), and `preload-error`; plus `src/main.tsx` global `error`/`unhandledrejection` handlers, a `[renderer] main.tsx evaluating` marker, and a try/catch around React mount with a `#root not found` fatal log. A future crash or hang on a user's machine now leaves a precise trace.

    ### Renderer console hygiene (2026-07-08) — clean startup logs for release

    Renderer-side warnings surfacing on every dev boot that needed to be silent before the next production release. None are crashes or functional bugs, but together they make production logs look noisier than the app actually is. All fixes verified via `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck:electron`, and `npm run build:electron`.

    - **`onConnect` no longer leaks onto the DOM `<button>`** (`src/components/ui/ConnectCalendarButton.tsx`). The custom callback prop was declared on `ConnectCalendarButtonProps` and consumed internally via `props.onConnect?.()`, but it was never destructured before spreading `...props` onto the native button, so React forwarded `onConnect` to the DOM and emitted `Warning: Unknown event handler property 'onConnect'. It will be ignored.` on every launcher mount. Now destructured alongside `className`/`variant`, with both call sites repointed to the local `onConnect`. The persisted-status mount check is intentionally pinned to `[]` with an `eslint-disable react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` so the unmemoized inline callback the Launcher passes (`onConnect={() => setIsCalendarConnected(true)}`) cannot cause repeated `getCalendarStatus()` IPC polls every render.

    - **Stable attendee keys eliminate the blank/duplicate React-key warning** (`src/components/Launcher.tsx`). The Launcher's next-meeting avatar row was using `key={a.email}`, so calendar attendees with empty `email` (resource rooms, unnamed invitees, some Google/Outlook entries) collapsed to duplicate `''` keys and triggered `Encountered two children with the same key, ''` on every poll. Now keyed on `email:${a.email}` when present, otherwise `${identity || 'attendee'}:${i}`. Index in the fallback is safe because `visibleAttendees` is a static `slice(0, 3)` (no reorder/filter between renders). `colorFor` was hardened in parallel with `attendeeIdentity || String(i)`. Also hardened the matching `initialsFor(a)` helper so a fully-empty attendee no longer risks `undefined.trim()` at render time — falls back to `'?'` instead.

    - **Shared theme subscription eliminates `MaxListenersExceededWarning`** (`src/hooks/useResolvedTheme.ts`). `useResolvedTheme` is called from ~25 sites (Launcher, NativelyInterface, SettingsOverlay, HelpSettings, meeting overlays, toasters, etc.), and each call was registering its own `ipcRenderer.on('theme:changed', …)` via the preload bridge — well past Node's default listener cap of 10, surfacing `MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 theme:changed listeners added`. Reworked to a single module-level subscription: one shared `MutationObserver` on `<html data-theme>` plus one shared IPC listener, fanning out to a `Set<setter>` of mounted hook consumers; the shared subscription tears down only when the last consumer unmounts. Live updates still fire on every theme change, the pre-React `data-theme`/`localStorage` write in the IPC handler stays in one place (single source of truth), and StrictMode mount→unmount→mount is idempotent via the existing guards. Net `theme:changed` listeners drop from ~27 (main.tsx + App.tsx + 25 hooks) to a small fixed count.

    - **Vite production chunk warning suppressed for an intentional Electron-local build** (`vite.config.mts`). The deliberate vendor split leaves the main entry at ~1.32 MB minified / ~329 kB gzipped — comfortably under our real budget (we ship assets locally; the constraint is gzipped size, not minified bytes). The previous `chunkSizeWarningLimit: 1000` flagged every release build. Raised to `1500` with a comment explaining the gzipped budget so future regressions still surface without blocking the build on already-known noise.

    - **Stable keys on every `<AnimatePresence>` child — 12+ duplicate-key warnings gone**. Five conditional `<motion.div>` blocks in `src/components/Launcher.tsx` (the profile-intel onboarding pill, modes onboarding pill, Ollama pull-status pill, per-meeting three-dot menu, and refresh-calendar toast) were missing stable `key` props. React 18 StrictMode's intentional dev-mode double-invoke caused AnimatePresence to emit duplicate-keyed siblings and flood the renderer console with `Encountered two children with the same key, '%s'` (12+ times during boot, more under hot-reload). Same pattern fixed in `src/components/SettingsOverlay.tsx` (provider dropdown + settings modal) and `src/components/MeetingChatOverlay.tsx` (chat modal). Per-meeting menu keys are now `meeting-menu-${m.id}` since `m.id` is stable across renders. No React dev console errors on boot anymore, and the next diagnostic pass will surface *real* warnings instead of this known noise.

    - **StrictMode-safe mount effects — no more double-fire IPC, double-incremented counters, or clobbered session models**. `src/components/Launcher.tsx` mount-only effect was bound to `seedDemo()` (which logged `[DatabaseManager] V3 demo meeting already exists, skipping seed.` twice on every dev boot) and to `localStorage.setItem('natively_launch_count_v2.7', …)` (which double-incremented the "What's New" pill counter on each hard refresh). Gated behind a module-scoped `mountedOnceRef` so StrictMode's mount→unmount→remount cycle is a no-op on the second pass while subscriptions stay fresh. `src/components/ModelSelectorWindow.tsx` mount effect was issuing `forceRestartOllama` IPC twice on every boot (since `getAvailableOllamaModels` returning `[]` followed the safe-reachability gate on both invocations) AND re-firing `loadModels()` on every renderer `focus` event (high-frequency when toggling launcher ↔ overlay). Replaced with a `cancelled`-flag async guard and dropped the `focus` listener — live updates still flow through the existing `onModelChanged` IPC subscription. `src/components/NativelyInterface.tsx` mount effect called `setModel(result.model)` twice, which clobbered the user's session-only model pick (set via `handleModelSelect`) back to the persisted default on every overlay mount. New `cancelled` flag short-circuits the Promise resolution when StrictMode unmounts mid-fetch. Net effect on the npm-start log: zero duplicate `seedDemo` lines, zero duplicate `force-restart-ollama` no-ops, and `[LLMHelper] Switched to Model` appears exactly once on overlay mount instead of three times.

    - **`AutoUpdater` feed URL now reports the real provider instead of `Deprecated. Do not use it.`** (`electron/main.ts`). `electron-updater@6.x` deprecated `getFeedURL()` — when no URL was explicitly set via `setFeedURL()`, the method returns the literal string `"Deprecated. Do not use it."` instead of resolving from `package.json`. The diagnostic log was telling us nothing useful. Reads `build.publish` (or top-level `publish`) directly from `package.json`, handling both object and array shapes (electron-builder allows a publish array for multi-channel), and renders e.g. `feed=github:Natively-AI-assistant/natively-cluely-ai-assistant`. A mis-pointed feed URL is now immediately diagnosable from the log and from any user bug report.

    ### Improvements & Fixes

    - **Permissions toaster: X now dismisses it, and a granted permission stops re-prompting** (2026-07-10). Two defects in the macOS onboarding permissions toaster, sharing one root cause. (1) **Re-prompt for an already-granted permission**: the `permissions:check` IPC handler (`electron/ipcHandlers.ts`) returned the raw `systemPreferences.getMediaAccessStatus('screen')` string, but on macOS that API misreports a genuinely-granted Screen Recording grant as `'denied'`/`'not-determined'` until the process is relaunched. The renderer mapped that to `macTCCBlocked = true` (`src/App.tsx`), and the onboarding stage catalog re-fired the toaster forever via its `reEligibility`/`skipWhen` predicates (`src/lib/onboarding/stageCatalog.ts`). The handler now falls back to a `desktopCapturer.getSources({ types: ['screen'] })` probe whenever the raw status is not `granted`/`restricted`: if screens are enumerable (`id` starts with `screen:`) the permission is effectively granted and it reports `'granted'`, clearing `macTCCBlocked`. The probe is raced against a 5 s deadline because `getSources` can block indefinitely on TCC — a timeout or thrown error keeps the raw not-granted status — mirroring the signal + timeout policy of `resolveMacScreenCaptureCapability` in `main.ts`. `'restricted'` (MDM/policy block) is deliberately left untouched so a genuine block still surfaces. (2) **X button did nothing**: the close handler was wired correctly (`PermissionsToaster.tsx` → `orch.markDismissed('permissions')`), but the orchestrator's `requestAnimationFrame` drain loop re-raised the toaster on the very next frame because `shouldShowToaster` stayed true — driven both by the false `macTCCBlocked` above and by the permissions dismiss handler only writing `permsShown` to localStorage, never to the live orchestrator user-state (unlike `trial_promo`). The dismiss handler now calls `orch.setUserState({ permsShown: true })` (`src/components/onboarding/OrchestratedToasterHost.tsx`) so `skipWhen` flips true in-session, and the orchestrator gained a non-persisted `dismissedThisSession` guard (`src/lib/onboarding/orchestrator.ts`): an explicit X holds for the rest of the session even if the permission is genuinely revoked mid-session, while a fresh launch still re-prompts. Tests: three new `permissions:check` cases in `electron/test/tcc-edge-cases.test.ts` (misread-`denied`-but-probe-succeeds → `granted`; genuinely-denied → stays `denied`; probe-hangs → timeout → stays `denied`) and a new class-level `src/lib/onboarding/__tests__/orchestratorClass.test.mjs` that loads the real `OnboardingOrchestrator` and asserts `markDismissed('permissions')` does not re-raise within a session even when `macTCCBlocked` is true, that a fresh instance does re-raise, and that dismissing permissions never wedges downstream stages. Electron + renderer typechecks clean; TCC 16/16, onboarding 56/56.

    - **Close Settings on outside click + Escape, matching Modes/Profile**: `SettingsOverlay` now closes when you click the dimmed area around the card, mirroring the `e.target === e.currentTarget` backdrop pattern that Modes Manager and Profile Intelligence already used (App.tsx:774/807). Pressing **Escape** closes whichever of the three center overlays is open (top-most-wins order: Settings > Modes > Profile) via a shared listener in App.tsx, plus an internal listener inside `SettingsOverlay` and `ProfileIntelligenceSettings` for consistency. The opacity-slider preview is guarded both with a JS early-return and `pointer-events: none` on the backdrop so dragging the slider can never dismiss Settings mid-drag. (`2299895` — 3 files, +121/-9.)

    - **STT API keys no longer silently lost when Windows DPAPI throws after `safeStorage.isEncryptionAvailable()` returns true** (`electron/services/CredentialsManager.ts`, `electron/services/__tests__/CredentialPersistenceBehavior.test.mjs`). A real production bug where Deepgram, Groq, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and other STT keys appeared to save successfully but vanished after restarting the app on Windows machines where DPAPI threw under policy restrictions, roaming profiles, or sandboxing — `isEncryptionAvailable()` returned `true` yet `encryptString()` threw on the actual call. The single `try` block in the previous `saveCredentials` jumped to `catch` and returned `false` without ever attempting the app-managed AES-256-GCM fallback, so the key was in memory but never reached disk. `saveCredentials()` now wraps the keyring write in its own try-catch: on a keyring throw it logs a warning and falls through to the `credentialFallbackCrypto.ts` encrypted fallback write (machine-bound via `os.userInfo`/machine-GUID, never plaintext at rest), and a successful fallback save unlinks any stale `credentials.enc` so `loadCredentials()` does not find it on next startup and silently overwrite the just-saved keys with old keyring data.

        - **Load-time stale-keyring defense**: `loadCredentials()` now compares mtimes of `credentials.enc` and `credentials.fallback.enc`. When the fallback is newer than the keyring, the stale keyring is unlinked before read — belt-and-suspenders for the rare case where save-time cleanup failed (locked file, `EACCES`) and the stale keyring would otherwise shadow the fresh fallback on next launch. The mtime-check invariant is documented in a comment block at the load site; the bounded mis-fire scenario (cross-machine backup-restore where the fallback has a different salt) is recoverable because GCM auth fails on decrypt and the user re-enters one key.

        - **Privacy/security tightening on the error path**: keyring catches now whitelist `error.message` only — DPAPI exceptions on Windows can include user SIDs and profile paths, and the original `console.warn(..., keyringErr)` would have leaked those to any downstream log scraper. Log phrasing in the reusable `removeKeyringFile` / `removeFallbackFile` helpers was also tightened (no more "fallback is authoritative" assertion in a helper that could be called from anywhere).

        - **Tests**: 4 new regression tests in `CredentialPersistenceBehavior.test.mjs` — save falls through to fallback when `encryptString` throws (the actual bug scenario); keyring-throws save leaves no stale `credentials.enc`; load detects stale-keyring via mtime and unlinks before read; load does NOT discard a fresh keyring when fallback is older (legitimate round-trip regression guard). `makeEnv()` gained an `encryptShouldThrow` knob for the first two. Full credential + STT suite 59/59 pass; `npm run build:electron` clean. Closes #369.

- **Launcher "stuck at logo" OOM crash — `quiet_window` onboarding stage missing `onceEver` (2026-07-19)**: The gate-only `quiet_window` onboarding stage was the only gate-only stage without `onceEver: true`. `OnboardingOrchestrator.evaluateAndDispatch()`'s `do { … } while (progressMade && !activeToasterId)` drain loop auto-completes gate-only stages, but `shouldShowToaster()` only suppresses a completed stage once `onceEver` is set — so once `quiet_window` became eligible (≥3 turns after `trial_promo`, including the crash's own auto-reload replaying persisted state), it re-completed on every pass, `progressMade` stayed `true`, and the loop spun synchronously forever, each pass calling `persist()` + `notify()` and driving launcher renderer RSS from ~2 GB to ~9 GB in ~90 s before an `exitCode 5` OOM crash and auto-reload repeat. Fixed by adding `onceEver: true` to `QUIET_WINDOW_STAGE` (matching the other gate-only stages, `profile_intelligence` and `modes_manager`) and bounding `evaluateAndDispatch`'s drain loop to `queue.length + 2` passes as defense-in-depth, so a future mis-configured gate-only stage degrades to a logged warning instead of a hang. New regression invariant in `stageCatalog.test.mjs` asserts every gate-only stage sets `onceEver`, checked against both the production TypeScript catalog and its `.mjs` test mirror. Also registers the `contextOsMultiFamilyEvidenceEnabled` flag in `intelligenceFlags.ts`, which was read in `ipcHandlers.ts` but never landed in the flag registry, failing `typecheck:electron` and blocking `app:build`. (#383)

- **Packaged local fallback + optional Ollama contract (2026-07-07)**: New `ProviderStatusRegistry` + `ProviderKind` / `ProviderHealth` / `ProviderStatus` shared contract (`electron/services/ProviderStatusRegistry.ts`, `providerStatus.ts`) broadcasts `provider-status-changed` over IPC; the renderer can poll `getProviderStatuses()` and subscribe to `onProviderStatusChanged`. New `LocalFallbackAssets` (`electron/services/LocalFallbackAssets.ts`) centralizes model path resolution (env / `process.resourcesPath/models` / `getAppPath()/resources/models` / dev-repo candidates) and a `Required Local Asset` list used by both the runtime preflight and the build-time verifier. New `LocalFallbackPreflight` (`electron/services/LocalFallbackPreflight.ts`) runs non-blocking ~1.5 s after window create, probes Transformers.js / `onnxruntime-common` / `onnxruntime-node` imports, the twelve required bundled model files (MiniLM + MobileBERT + BGE reranker q8), the Rust native audio module, `better-sqlite3`, `sharp` (arm64+x64), `sqlite-vec` (arm64+x64), and the optional Ollama probe; publishes `local-embedding` / `intent-classifier` / `local-reranker` / `native-audio` provider statuses; never throws. New `workerStatus.ts` provides a structured `LocalWorkerStatus` discriminated union and `classifyWorkerFailure` (module-missing / native-addon-missing / model-missing / memory-pressure / init-timeout / unknown); each ONNX worker emits a `status` message before any `ready`/`error` payload and the host latches `nonRecoverableLoadError` for non-recoverable failures so subsequent calls fail fast instead of retrying on every request. New bundled model: `Xenova/bge-reranker-base` (q8) shipped in `resources/models/` so smart-retrieval Phase 1 works offline on a fresh install (replaces the previous lazy-download path; the reranker download provider still acts as a no-op fallback for older installs). `OllamaManager` gating rewritten: `skipStartup()` / `ensureRunning({ reason })` / `probe()` with single-flighted `ensuringPromise`, ENOENT classified as `missing_optional_dependency` and downgraded to `console.warn` (was `[ERROR]`), and the `child.on('close', ...)` handler publishes `unavailable` with a 60 s backoff for app-managed spawns. `LLMHelper.forceRestartOllama` short-circuits to `false` when `!this.useOllama`, and the IPC handlers (`force-restart-ollama`, `restart-ollama`, `ensure-ollama-running`) gate on `llmHelper.isUsingOllama()` so a stray renderer mount cannot spawn a daemon the user never asked for. `package.json#build.asarUnpack` now explicitly names `better-sqlite3`, `keytar`, `sqlite-vec` (+ platform variants), `sharp`, `@img/sharp*`, `@napi-rs/*`, and the reranker download worker. New `scripts/verify-packaged-local-assets.mjs` (source + packaged mode), `scripts/smoke-packaged-local-fallback.mjs` (clean-machine launch), `docs/engineering/PACKAGING_GUARANTEES.md` (the single source of truth for the contract). 24 new tests across `OllamaManagerGating2026_07_07`, `LocalFallbackPreflight2026_07_07`, `WorkerStatusContract2026_07_07`, `IntentWorkerMidLoadLatch2026_07_07`, `NewUserPcHardening2026_07_07`, `AdversarialNewInstall2026_07_07`; all pass. (24 files, +1540/-178.)

### Fresh-profile install reliability (2026-07-08) — "works 10 min, then crashes, never opens"

Production failures specifically on a brand-new macOS profile (clean userData, no Ollama, no API keys) where the .dmg was installed, worked briefly, and then refused to launch. Dev never reproduced it; the prior five-boot audit surfaced three production-specific gaps. The packaged build is now production-safe on a clean install.

- **WAL checkpoint on shutdown is no longer missing** (`electron/db/DatabaseManager.ts`, `electron/main.ts`). The `DatabaseManager` singleton held a `better-sqlite3` connection in `journal_mode = WAL` and **never called `db.close()` or `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` in `before-quit`**. A force-quit (e.g. user ⌘Q during a meeting, macOS sending SIGKILL after a hang, or `kill -9` from the auto-update flow) left the `-wal` file mid-transaction. The next launch's `new Database(dbPath)` either hung on a kernel lock the OS believed was held by the dead process, or read partial data, failed a migration, and degraded to `db: null` silently — exactly the "never opens again" symptom. Two new public methods on `DatabaseManager`: `checkpoint()` (runs `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` synchronously, no-op if `db` is null) and `close()` (idempotent; checkpoint + close + clear the cached handle). `before-quit` now calls `checkpoint()` immediately after `setQuitting(true)` as the early safety net, and again with `close()` near the end as the durable flush. Test: `electron/db/__tests__/WalCheckpointShutdown2026_07_08.test.mjs`.

- **Preflight timer cannot keep the process alive past quit** (`electron/main.ts`). The recently-added `LocalFallbackPreflight` runs in a `setTimeout(..., NATIVELY_LOCAL_PREFLIGHT_DELAY_MS || '1500')` that previously could fire during `before-quit` and (a) read from `process.resourcesPath` / `app.getPath` which throw during teardown, or (b) keep the event loop alive after quit. Added an `appState.isQuitting()` short-circuit at the top of the timer callback (the preflight is meaningless during shutdown anyway) and `preflightTimer.unref()` so the timer does not keep the main process alive past `before-quit`. The `try`/`catch` around `require` and the `.catch()` on the Promise were already correct.

- **Release-gate quarantine check** (`.github/workflows/release-macos.yml`). A signed + notarized binary can still carry `com.apple.quarantine` if the build pipeline ran without re-signing; a fresh-macOS-profile first-launch then shows "Natively.app is damaged and can't be opened", and a force-quit mid-session can re-apply the flag. The signature/notarization step now also runs `xattr -l "$APP" 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'com.apple.quarantine'` and **fails the build** with an `::error::` annotation if either the `.app` bundle or the `.dmg` carry the flag. The `spctl -a` and `xcrun stapler validate` steps were already gated; this is the missing piece that catches a build pipeline regression.

    - **Prompt caching for Claude Opus 4.8**: `getClaudeCacheMinChars` now matches the whole `claude-opus-4-` family instead of enumerating point releases, so `claude-opus-4-8` uses the correct 4,096-token (16,384-char) cache minimum. It previously fell through to the generic 1,024-token floor, which silently disabled prompt caching for prompts between those two sizes.

    - **Custom Provider (OpenRouter + any cURL gateway) reachable on the typed-chat and voice-Answer paths**: Fixed a regression where the live typed-chat and voice "Answer" cascade silently bypassed the user's configured Custom Provider. The chain now consults `configuredCustomProviders` (preserved across model selections in `setModel`) as a last-resort rung before the "No AI provider configured" throw, and also adds it as a fallback rung in the Natively TTFT race so it can win under the 2.5 s first-token budget. Previously, selecting any non-custom model (e.g. Gemini) caused `setModel` to null out `this.customProvider`, leaving a paid OpenRouter key unused even when every other cloud key was exhausted — the chain only consulted `streamChatWithGemini`'s offline-RAG path, which is never reached from the user's typed-chat or voice path. Both rungs are gated on `!isLocalOnlyMode` and `!(isMultimodal && imagePaths)` so local-only mode and image-bearing requests are unchanged.

    - **DeepSeek 402 Insufficient Balance no longer retries 4–5× per chat**: `streamWithDeepseek` now catches permanent key/billing errors via the existing `isPermanentKeyError` classifier and flips a per-session `deepseekPermanentlyDead` breaker so the chain stops re-attempting the dead endpoint across rotations. The flag resets on either branch of `setDeepseekApiKey` (empty wipe + new key). A one-shot `deepseekSkipWarned` flag suppresses the "permanently disabled" log line so it doesn't spam every chat after the trip.

    - **Tests**: Added `electron/services/__tests__/CustomProviderFallback2026_07_05.test.mjs` with 10 regression tests covering the new fallback chain (`setModel` preservation, picker logic for cloud/custom/empty-curlCommand/no-config cases, DeepSeek 402 breaker, both `setDeepseekApiKey` reset branches, and the `isLocalOnlyMode` gate).

    ### Bug Fixes (2026-07-06 dev-loop hardening)

Five real bugs the user hit in one working session (live logs from `~/Library/Application Support/natively/logs`), plus a final pre-flight fix uncovered when verifying the dev-loop closed cleanly. All fixes carry regression tests; typecheck + the touched test suites are green. Net: every "not working / not indexing / responses failing" symptom from the original 2026-07-05 report is now closed end-to-end.

#### Critical

- **`processResponse` substring filter was throwing on real answers** (`electron/LLMHelper.ts:1202`). `processResponse` matched `I'm not sure` / `It depends` / `I can't answer` / `I don't know` as **substrings**, so any honest, useful answer merely *containing* one of those phrases (e.g. `"I don't know his exact title, but he's on the platform team"`) was thrown away — silently killing every `tryGenerateResponse` and `generateSummary` fallback chain, surfacing the "Filtered fallback response" error and producing 76-character canned replies. Tightened to an exact match on the entire trimmed/punctuation-stripped response via a new module-scope `isCannedFallbackPhrase()` helper. `SessionTracker.addAssistantMessage` (the same shape of bug, `electron/SessionTracker.ts:276`) got the identical exact-match fix using a local copy of the helper to avoid a cross-module import for one function. Without both fixes, every "honest partial answer" and every "session memory recall" was being silently lost. New regression: `electron/llm/__tests__/CannedFallbackPhraseFilter2026_07_05.test.mjs` (6/6 passing).

- **`@huggingface/transformers` not in `asarUnpack`, breaking IntentClassifier at runtime** (`package.json`). The four ONNX-worker `.js` files (`whisperWorker.js`, `intentClassifierWorker.js`, `localEmbeddingWorker.js`, `localRerankerWorker.js`) are already asar-unpacked, but `node_modules/@huggingface/transformers` itself wasn't — so a dynamic `import()` from an unpacked file couldn't reach back into the packed `node_modules`, producing the user's intermittent `[IntentClassifier] Failed to load zero-shot worker model: Cannot find package '@huggingface/transformers'` error. The naive "add to esbuild externals" fix is a no-op because the import is hidden inside `new Function('return import("@huggingface/transformers")')` specifically to dodge esbuild's static analysis (see `electron/audio/whisper/whisperWorker.ts:11-15` for the rationale). The correct fix is to unpack the package's `node_modules` directory alongside the worker scripts. Added `"**/node_modules/@huggingface/transformers/**"` to `package.json` asarUnpack. New regression assertion: `electron/rag/__tests__/OnnxWorkerIsolationHardening2026_07_05.test.mjs:286-298` (14/14 suite passing).

- **`set-gemini-api-key` / `set-openai-api-key` never told the embedder, so reference files stayed `lexical_only` until app restart** (`electron/ipcHandlers.ts:3580, 3644`). Both handlers updated the LLMHelper for chat but never called `ragManager.initializeEmbeddings(...)` after the key changed — only `ProcessingHelper.loadStoredCredentials` (boot) and `AppState.bootstrapOllamaEmbeddings` (Ollama-pull completion) ever did. A key entered live via the Settings UI never reached the embedder, so ModeHybridRetriever kept logging `[ModeHybridRetriever] Embedding provider unavailable, using lexical fallback` for the rest of the session. Mirrors the existing `AppState.bootstrapOllamaEmbeddings` pattern at `electron/main.ts:1176-1182`: after saving the key, also call `ragManager.initializeEmbeddings({...})` and `appState.scheduleModeReferenceIndexRetry()`, gated on `keyChanged` to avoid redundant work on re-saves. New regression: `electron/services/__tests__/ApiKeySetterEmbeddingRetry2026_07_05.test.mjs` (3/3 passing, plus explicit "Groq is not an embedding provider" test so reviewers don't add a needless re-init there).

#### High

- **`ModeContextRetriever.ensureHybridRetriever` was constructing a doomed retriever on a cold-start race** (`electron/services/ModeContextRetriever.ts:1513`). Whenever a query raced ahead of `AppState.initializeRAGManager()` (or that init threw), the previous code path constructed a brand-new `new EmbeddingPipeline(db, vectorStore)` with `provider === null` and cached it as `_hybridRetriever`. Nothing in the cached retriever was ever initialized, so `ModeHybridRetriever.isEmbeddingAvailable()` returned `false` forever for that one instance — `setSharedEmbeddingPipeline()`'s cache-invalidation only helps if it is ever called at all; if `RAGManager` init failed it never is. Fix: return `null` (and touch no DB) whenever `_sharedEmbeddingPipeline` is null, letting callers take their existing lexical-fallback path and try again cheaply on the next call. The `setSharedEmbeddingPipeline()` setter's null-out of `_hybridRetriever` is preserved as the "RAGManager did init, real pipeline is available" case. New regression: `electron/services/__tests__/ModeContextRetrieverPipelineRace2026_07_05.test.mjs` (4/4 passing).

- **`EmbeddingPipeline.isReady()` returned `true` during the local provider's cold-load window** (`electron/rag/EmbeddingPipeline.ts:159`). `LocalEmbeddingProvider` is assigned to `this.provider` the instant `_doInitialize()` resolves it (the constructor is cheap — no worker spawn, no ONNX load), but the actual model load happens lazily inside `ensureLoaded()` and can take up to 60 s cold. `isReady()` previously only checked `provider !== null`, so it reported `true` during that whole cold-start window. `ModeHybridRetriever.isEmbeddingAvailable()` gates on this synchronously inside a live per-query retrieval budget — during the cold window it took the hybrid branch and then stalled up to 60 s on `getEmbeddingForQuery()`. Fix: added an optional synchronous `isLoaded?(): boolean` to `IEmbeddingProvider` (only `LocalEmbeddingProvider` implements it, returning its real `loaded` field). `EmbeddingPipeline.isReady()` now reads `provider.isLoaded?.() ?? true` — cloud HTTP providers (Gemini/OpenAI/Ollama) have no warm-up state, so the `?? true` default preserves their existing behavior exactly. New regression: `electron/rag/__tests__/EmbeddingPipelineIsReadyColdStart2026_07_05.test.mjs` (3/3 passing — covers cold→warm→cold-again transition AND the no-regression cloud-provider case).

#### Dev-loop fix

- **`npm start` (→ `app:dev` → `electron:dev`) couldn't find `dist-electron/electron/main.js`** (`package.json`). The `build` script ran `clean && tsc && vite build` — the renderer build only — so after `clean` wiped `dist-electron/` nothing ever re-created it. `electron:dev` called `npm run build && electron .`, found nothing under `dist-electron/electron/`, and exited with the user's `"Cannot find module .../dist-electron/electron/main.js"` error. Fix: `electron:dev` is now `npm run build && npm run build:electron && cross-env NODE_ENV=development electron .` — `build:electron` runs AFTER `build`'s `clean` step (otherwise `clean` would wipe the just-built electron bundle). Matches the `electron:build` pattern already in use.

- **Dev Electron.app shows 3 Dock icons on `npm start`** (`scripts/patch-electron-plist.js` + `package.json:14` postinstall). Three icons appear because (1) the stock dev `node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app/Contents/Info.plist` has no `LSUIElement=1` (macOS paints a generic "Electron" tile at process-spawn, before any JS runs), (2) `main.ts:5957-5958 applyInitialDisguise()` triggers a LaunchServices re-register that paints a "Natively" tile, (3) `main.ts:6098-6100 setActivationPolicy('regular')` after `createWindow()` promotes a third visible tile. The in-code fix (`accessory` clamp before rename, `regular` promotion after `createWindow()`, both in `e5edd87`) is correct but cannot prevent the OS from painting the spawn-time tile. The `patch-electron-plist.js` postinstall patch that injects `LSUIElement=1` was never run on this machine. The fix: run `node scripts/patch-electron-plist.js` once, which writes `LSUIElement=1` into the dev `Info.plist`. With that in place, dev launches show exactly one "Natively" tile (matching the prod signed-build behavior). If LaunchServices has cached a stale identity, the canonical macOS follow-up is `lsregister -f -R .../Electron.app`.

#### Out of scope after investigation (deliberately NOT changed)

- **`WhatToAnswerLLM` reference-files "ScopeFallback" / "Ollama unavailable, omitting from context"` was a deliberate privacy safeguard, not a bug.** Cross-verified against `electron/llm/ProviderRouter.ts:5-6` (type), `src/components/settings/AIProvidersSettings.tsx:1665-1704` (UI — "Cloud provider data scopes — fail-closed cloud share controls"), and the same exact pattern repeated verbatim in `MeetingPersistence.ts:265` for `post_call_summary`. A reference-file payload reaches the cloud embedding provider whenever a cloud embedder is active; routing around the Ollama-availability check when a cloud embedder is reachable would silently violate a user's explicit "don't send my reference files to the cloud" opt-out. Documented in this changelog as out-of-scope after the original "fix" was reverted, so future readers don't re-propose the same misdiagnosis.

### Seminar-mode (document-grounded) RAG hardening (2026-07-06)

Architecture-discovery pass followed by the top-5 fixes on the `hardening/v2.7.0` branch, addressing the recurring failure mode where seminar/custom-mode questions (e.g. "What are the two research questions?", "What GPU was used for training?", "What is a Vision-Language-Action model?", "What was the total cost of building the teleoperation system?") answered from the abstract / methodology / teleoperation section instead of the dedicated answer section. Root cause: the doc-grounded `lecture_answer` path was chunk-only with no OKF-card augmentation on the WTA path, no entity-anchor on the lexical rescue, no question-shape routing to `definitional_answer` / `list_answer` / `exact_numeric_answer` / `document_absent_fact_refusal`, and several production flag defaults at OFF (OKF, cross-encoder rerank, graph expansion, confidence gate). Five reports produced under `docs/` (`AI_ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`, `SEMINAR_MODE_REQUEST_FLOW.md`, `RETRIEVAL_SYSTEMS_COMPARISON.md`, `FAILURE_ANALYSIS_BEFORE_FIX.md`, `FIX_PLAN_AFTER_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md`); the 5 flag flips and 4 of the 5 plan fixes are now in code. Typecheck clean (no new errors vs HEAD). Functional test of `classifyDocumentQuestionShape` on the 6 benchmark questions confirms the expected AnswerType for each (Q1/Q3/Q4 → `list_answer`; Q2 → `definitional_answer`; Q5 → `exact_numeric_answer`; Q6 → `document_absent_fact_refusal`).

#### Production flag flips — always ON

Five `electron/intelligence/intelligenceFlags.ts` defaults flipped from `false` / `isInternalDevTestContext()` to `true` per user directive. SettingsManager overrides and `NATIVELY_*` env overrides still take precedence — these only change the default when neither is set. (5 files + 2 collateral, +20/-13.)

- `ragConfidenceGate` (`electron/intelligence/intelligenceFlags.ts:208`). Default OFF → ON. Emits the `confidence` field on every `ModeRetrievedContext` so downstream consumers (local rerank escalation, debug IPC) have a real signal.
- `ragLocalRerank` (`:211`). Default OFF → ON. bge-reranker-base cross-encoder re-orders the top-30 candidates on manual/follow-up queries whose confidence gate trips. Prewarmed at mode activation so cold-load cost doesn't gate TTFT.
- `ragSpeculativeRerank` (`:217`). Default OFF → ON. Extends the same rerank escalation to the LIVE WTA path inside the existing `raceWithBudget(1500ms)` envelope. Falls through to lexical on overrun.
- `okfHybridRetrieval` (`:224`). Default `isInternalDevTestContext()` (OFF in production) → ON. OKF Knowledge Cards augment retrieval; **synthesis-question types (`research_questions`, `objectives`, `main_topic`, `summary`, `problem_statement`, `conclusion`) return ALL cards in document order** — the dominant recovery lever for Q1 and Q3.
- `okfGraphExpansion` (`:227`). Default OFF → ON. Entity/relation BFS over OKF packs (depth ≤2) appends graph hints after cards. Provides related-concept disambiguation for definitional questions (Q2).

Collateral flips (same `isInternalDevTestContext()` pattern, flipped for consistency): `okfKnowledgePacks` (`:221`), `okfMarkdownExport` (`:222`).

Side effect: `docGroundedFalseRefusalRepair` is no longer inert. That flag (already default ON) was previously gated on `okfHybridRetrieval` for the `hasEntityEvidence` derivation that powers the false-refusal gate. With OKF ON, the false-refusal repair can now fire when the model says "I could not find that" despite strong retrieved evidence.

Not flipped: `ragRrfFusion` (no live consumer wired), all profile-side flags (`okfProfilePacks` / `okfProfileHybridRetrieval` / etc.), `hindsightMemory` / `hindsightLiveRecall`, `promptAssemblerV2` (shadow only), Profile Intelligence / Profile Graph wiring (gated by code, not flags).

#### Fix 1b — WTA path consumes OKF cards (`electron/services/ModesManager.ts`, `electron/llm/WhatToAnswerLLM.ts`)

Added `ModesManager.buildOkfAugmentedContextBlock(modeContextBlock, query, pinnedModeId?)` (~60 LOC) — mirrors the manual-path OKF block at `LLMHelper.ts:4640-4704`. Calls `queryOkfCards` per file (with `QuestionClassifier.classifyQuestion`), sorts scored cards across files, takes top-6, formats via `formatCardsForPrompt`, optionally appends graph hints via `GraphRetriever.expandGraph`, then prepends ahead of raw chunks via `buildOkfEvidenceBlock`. Returns `modeContextBlock` unchanged when the flag is off, when there are no reference files, or when no pack has cards yet (additive, never destructive). Threaded through the `ModesManagerType` type in `WhatToAnswerLLM.ts` and called at line ~333 right after the chunk retrieval. Guarded by `forceDocumentGrounding` and `typeof modesManager.buildOkfAugmentedContextBlock === 'function'` (backward compatible with older module shapes). Closes the synthesis-question gap on the WTA path; Q1, Q3, Q4 benefit on the manual path AND the WTA path.

#### Fix 2 — Identity-block suppression on entity queries (already in place, verified)

The fix-plan called for suppressing `<document_identity>` on entity-specific queries. Verified that both retrievers already gate identity on `isBroadDocumentQuery`: `electron/services/ModeContextRetriever.ts:849-850` and `electron/services/modes/ModeHybridRetriever.ts:1105`. The `classifyDocumentQuestionShape` heuristic in `electron/llm/documentGroundedPrompt.ts:320-332` already returns `broad_overview` only for true broad questions ("what is this document about", "summarize", "overview", "main topic", "high-level", "gist"). All 6 benchmark questions have question shapes other than `broad_overview`, so identity is correctly suppressed. No code change needed.

#### Fix 3 — Entity-anchor guard on the lexical synonym rescue (`electron/services/ModeContextRetriever.ts:1189-1227`)

The synonym rescue admitted any chunk containing a generic section word ("abstract", "methodology", "phase", "stage"), which let the abstract chunk beat the precise answer chunk whenever the answer chunk happened to not contain the synonym. Added an entity-anchor gate: when the query has entity terms (extracted via the existing `extractHighSignalEntityTerms`), a synonym-rescued chunk must ALSO contain at least one entity term (lowercased, pure-numbers filtered out). When entity-anchor is active, the synonym-hint weight drops from 0.40 → 0.30 so the base score + entity match dominates. Falls through to the original behaviour for entity-less queries (broad/vague questions) so the existing rescue is preserved. The abstract chunk no longer wins over the precise answer chunk on Q2 ("What is a Vision-Language-Action model?"), Q4 ("What objects were used in the robotic tasks?"), and Q5 ("What GPU was used for training?").

#### Fix 4 — Question-shape classifier surgical fix (`electron/llm/documentGroundedPrompt.ts:320-345`)

The AnswerTypes `definitional_answer`, `list_answer`, `exact_numeric_answer`, `document_absent_fact_refusal`, and `document_followup_answer` already existed (AnswerPlanner.ts:29-33) and were already wired through `requiredLayersFor` (AnswerPlanner.ts:1513-1519), `formatAnswerPlanForPrompt` (AnswerPlanner.ts:1458-1467), and the doc-grounded `planAnswer` dispatch (AnswerPlanner.ts:2264-2273). The templates `DOCUMENT_DEFINITION_TEMPLATE`, `DOCUMENT_LIST_TEMPLATE`, `DOCUMENT_NUMERIC_TEMPLATE`, `DOCUMENT_ABSENT_FACT_TEMPLATE`, and `DOCUMENT_FOLLOWUP_TEMPLATE` already existed (AnswerPlanner.ts:333-337). `planAnswer` already called `classifyDocumentQuestionShape` and routed to the new types when `documentGroundedCustomModeActive`.

The only real defect was in `classifyDocumentQuestionShape`: the definitional regex had an over-aggressive negative lookahead that excluded "model", which mis-routed "What is a Vision-Language-Action model?" to `lecture_answer` instead of `definitional_answer`. Replaced the broken regex with a clean 3-flag check: `looksDefinitional && !looksLikeList && !looksLikeSpec`, where:
- `looksDefinitional` matches `^define|definition of|what does .+ mean|what is (?:a|an|the)? ...|what are (?:a|the)? ...$` (allows hyphens in the noun so "Vision-Language-Action" routes correctly; no `\b` at the end because `-` isn't a word char)
- `looksLikeList` matches explicit number words (`two|three|four|...|\d+`) or list markers (`list|which|state rq|all the`)
- `looksLikeSpec` matches numeric/size/value probes (`how many`, `what gpu|memory|rate|size`, `used for training|inference`, etc.)

Functional test on the 6 benchmark questions after the fix: Q1/Q3/Q4 → `list_answer`; Q2 → `definitional_answer` (was `lecture_answer`); Q5 → `exact_numeric_answer`; Q6 → `document_absent_fact_refusal`. Q2 now routes through `DOCUMENT_DEFINITION_TEMPLATE` and `requiredLayersFor` keeps `reference_files` required.

#### Source-isolation and WTA close-out (2026-07-06)

Follow-up commit `27ab03a` closes the high-risk gaps from the seminar-mode architecture review and hardens all document-grounded custom modes, not just the original seminar fixture.

- **Document-grounded WTA now validates and repairs answers instead of trusting the first generation.** `IntelligenceEngine` calls the document-grounded validator on WTA answers, attempts a bounded repair when the answer is incomplete, rejects repairs that invent numeric values not present in the evidence block, and fails closed with a safe refusal when the repair is still untrusted. This directly closes the prior gap where WTA could still confabulate on absent facts or partial numeric/list answers even though the manual path was better guarded. Regression coverage: `electron/llm/__tests__/DocGroundedCompleteness2026_07_05.test.mjs`.

- **WTA retrieves by the planned/latest question, not by the whole transcript blob.** `WhatToAnswerLLM` now uses `answerPlan.question.trim() || cleanedTranscript` as the retrieval query. This prevents stale transcript context (profile projects, earlier answers, unrelated chat history) from pulling the retriever toward the wrong source when the active mode is a document-grounded custom mode.

- **Forced document-grounded retrieval is hybrid-first again.** `ModesManager.buildRetrievedActiveModeContextBlockHybrid` no longer short-circuits `forceDocumentGrounding` to the lexical-only path. It tries `ModeHybridRetriever.retrieve(...)` first and falls back to lexical only when hybrid reports `usedFallback` or throws. `ModeHybridRetriever.retrieve` now accepts `forceDocumentGrounding`, builds the document identity block itself, and keeps the identity block gated to broad overview questions only so fact/list/definition questions rank precise chunks above abstract metadata. Regression coverage: `electron/services/__tests__/HybridDocumentGroundingPath.test.mjs`.

- **Custom-mode source isolation is centralized and enforced.** New `customModeExecutionContract` logic defines which context layers each custom/document-grounded mode is allowed to use, suppressing profile/JD/resume/company/persona/custom-notes/coding-template leakage unless the active mode explicitly permits that source. This is the guard that prevents TalentScope/project/coding scaffold drift from leaking into seminar/thesis answers. Regression coverage: `electron/llm/__tests__/CustomModeSourceIsolation2026_07_06.test.mjs` and related WTA/source-isolation tests.

- **Seminar fixture now tests realistic document-grounded behavior end-to-end.** `SeminarPresentationAssistant.test.mjs` covers 17 uploaded-thesis facts (main topic, OpenVLA/OpenVLA-OFT, AutoGen, Mercury X1 DOF/sensors, ROS#/Unity/Meta Quest 3/cameras, LoRA, Success Rate/MSE, project phases, semantic/prompt-complexity/self-awareness benchmarks), stale-profile drift isolation, deletion cleanup, binary-like noise, and prompt-injection wrapping. The focused suite is green: `npm run build:electron` plus `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 electron --test ...` reported **46/46 passing** for the document-grounding close-out set.

- **Local ONNX/reranker worker hardening landed with the same pass.** Local embedding/rerank workers now isolate ONNX/transformers loading behind worker entrypoints, add thread/config hardening, and move bge-reranker assets to the download path instead of vendoring the huge tokenizer payload in the repo. This keeps the always-on rerank flags from turning first-use model loading into a live-answer stall.

#### Remaining gaps (deferred)

- **WTA-path OKF augmentation still depends on OKF packs being already generated.** The `KnowledgeManager.generateForFile` path is async + single-flight; on the first WTA turn after upload, the pack may not be ready and augmentation can fall through to chunk-only. Warm generation at upload/index completion remains the mitigation.
- **First-token latency needs live smoke coverage under a cold local model cache.** The deterministic worker/reranker tests cover the code paths, but a packaged-app smoke should still verify that a completely cold bge/ONNX cache degrades to lexical within the WTA budget instead of blocking the live answer.

### Code Review Fixes (2026-07-06)

Hardening pass from a launch-log code review on the `hardening/v2.7.0` branch. Eight items: two CRITICAL, two HIGH, two MEDIUM, two LOW.

#### Critical

- **Native module rebuild for Apple Silicon (better-sqlite3, keytar)**: Resolved `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED` from an x86_64 `.node` binary on arm64 hardware (Rosetta-drift during a prior install). Rebuilt both modules from source against the real hardware arch via `scripts/rebuild-native-electron.js`. Verified arm64 via `file` + `lipo -info`. Smoke load test + `ReferenceFilePageCountPersistence.test.mjs` (5/5) green under `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`. Required version bump `better-sqlite3` 12.6.2 → 12.11.1 to compile against the current Electron V8 headers.
- **PhoneMirror LAN-bind confirmation dialog + bind-address UI**: Closing the plaintext-HTTP-on-LAN attack surface on `0.0.0.0:4123`. The first `phone-mirror:set-lan` flip to ON per session now triggers a native `dialog.showMessageBoxSync` ("Allow LAN access? This will bind Natively to 0.0.0.0:4123 so any device on this Wi-Fi network can connect with the pairing token. Continue?" — Cancel is the default button). On Cancel the toggle stays off and the UI does not flip optimistically. Phone token is regenerated on every `exposeOnLan` transition (already in place; now documented). Settings now surfaces the live bind address in the Enable row — `On — port 4123 · bound to 0.0.0.0 (LAN) · 0 phones connected` vs `bound to 127.0.0.1 (loopback only)`.

#### High

- **Vite dynamic-import warnings resolved**: Two modules were both statically AND dynamically imported, defeating code-splitting. Dropped the dead dynamic import of `analytics.service` in `ConnectCalendarButton.tsx` (use the static import — calendar button cannot render before the app shell). Dropped the dead dynamic import of `orchestrator` in `App.tsx` (already statically imported by both `App.tsx` itself and `OrchestratedToasterHost.tsx`). Vite build is now clean of dynamic-import warnings for these two modules.
- **Renderer bundle vendor split**: Added `build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks` to `vite.config.mts`, partitioning deps into seven vendor buckets (`react-vendor`, `animation-vendor`, `icon-vendor`, `radix-vendor`, `markdown-vendor`, `media-vendor`, `data-vendor`). Renderer main entry dropped from **2.38 MB raw / 662 kB gzip** to **1.32 MB raw / 328 kB gzip**. Largest single chunk is now `markdown-vendor` at 628 kB (dominated by `react-syntax-highlighter` — orthogonal follow-up).

#### Medium

- **`ModelVersionManager` tier label split**: Operator-facing summary was collapsing T2 and T3 into a single slot (`T1=… | T2/T3=…`), which silently drops `tier3` from telemetry if a third tier is populated. Reformatted both the Vision and Text summaries to `T1=… | T2=… | T3=…`.
- **Whisper Apple Silicon dtype default**: Default per-module dtype on Apple Silicon flipped from uniform `fp32` to `WHISPER_SAFE_DTYPE` (fp32 encoder + q8 decoders) — ~4× size and latency win on CoreML-backed inference with negligible WER impact. New `whisperAppleSiliconDtype` setting (`fp32` / `q8` / `q4` / `int8` / `mixed`) lets users opt back to fp32 if a particular model's quantized variant regresses on their hardware.

#### Low / Verified

- **`HindsightManager` round-4 `isAppManaged` fix verified intact**: The debounced-Settings-save clobbering bug (orphan server tree, held port 8888) stays fixed. Guards at line 573 (`if (!isAppManaged) broadcastStatus('ready')`) and line 935 (`stopSync` bail-out) are present and correct.

### Skills Delete Subsystem (2026-07-06)

The skill-delete feature in commit `76d531b` was reviewed by the `code-reviewer` agent and the user's `/humanize-ai-text is deletable` report. Two real findings, plus a documented defense-in-depth path.

#### High

- **Builtin classification now checks the parsed id, not just the folder name** (`bbed668`): `SkillsManager.loadUserSkills()` was classifying a skill as `'builtin'` only via `BUILTIN_SKILL_IDS.has(entry.name)` — the on-disk folder name. The seeded `humanize-text` folder has `name: humanize-ai-text` in its SKILL.md frontmatter (the slug is what the user sees as the `/skill id`), so the parsed `skill.id` and the folder name diverge. The original logic happened to work for today's install but was fragile to any folder rename (a maintainer adding a version suffix, a user's manual edit via the "open skills folder" escape hatch, a migration) — the rename would silently re-classify the builtin as `'userData'` and make it deletable. Fix: `BUILTIN_SKILL_IDS` now includes **both** `'humanize-text'` (folder) and `'humanize-ai-text'` (parsed id); classification accepts a match against either key. New regression test renames the seeded folder to a non-builtin name and asserts the parsed-id fallback still classifies it correctly AND that `deleteSkill('humanize-ai-text')` is STILL refused. Locks the contract — a future contributor who "simplifies" the check back to folder-only will fail the test on the spot. The SkillsManager comment block now also documents the requirement to keep `SkillsManager.BUILTIN_SKILL_IDS` in sync with `SkillValidator.DEFAULT_BUILTIN_SKILL_IDS` whenever a new builtin ships (the upload pipeline uses the validator's set for collision detection; the manager's set for source classification — adding a builtin requires updating both).

- **TOCTOU window in `deleteSkill` closed via `fs.realpathSync`** (part of `76d531b`): The first version of `deleteSkill` resolved the path to delete via `path.dirname(skill.filePath)` and used `path.resolve()` for the containment check before `fs.rmSync(realTargetDir, {recursive:true,force:true})`. This was vulnerable to a symlink-swap between `loadSkills()` and the delete: an attacker with write access to the skills dir could replace the skill folder with a symlink pointing elsewhere, and `rmSync`'s `force: true` would happily follow the symlink and wipe an arbitrary directory outside `skillsDir`. Fix: derive the target from `path.join(this.skillsDir, folderName)` (independent of any prior stat), then `fs.realpathSync` both the target and `skillsDir` at delete-time and verify the resolved target still starts with the resolved `skillsDir`. Error messages are sanitized ("Could not delete skill.") — the resolved realpath is NEVER leaked to the renderer (would expose internal paths). New regression test plants a `victim` dir outside `skillsDir`, swaps the skill folder for a symlink to the victim, and asserts the victim file survives intact + the error message doesn't leak path information.

#### Verified / Documented Only

- **Defense-in-depth gate at `/skill-name` invocation site** (part of `76d531b`): Verified that `NativelyInterface.tsx:3838`'s `onGeminiStreamError` handler already calls `flushToken()` + `setIsProcessing(false)` + clears `chatStreamIdRef` (and `inputValue` is cleared on submit at line 4176 BEFORE the IPC call), so the disabled-skill error path leaves no stale chat-panel state. No fix needed; documented for the next reviewer.

#### UX Polish

- **Hover-reveal animation matches the meeting-notes idiom** (`084252d`): The Trash2 button wrapper originally used a plain `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity` fade — functional but inconsistent with the rest of the app's settings surfaces, where the meeting-notes action bar at `MeetingDetails.tsx:696` establishes the canonical hover-reveal contract (subtle `translate-y-1` slide-up + 160 ms `ease-out`, gated on `[@media(hover:hover)]` for mouse-capable devices, `[@media(hover:none)]:opacity-100` always-visible fallback for touch hardware, plus `group-focus-within` so keyboard users can tab to the button and see it appear). Matching the same idiom means every settings panel that exposes a hover action reveals the affordance with the same timing and easing — users see one consistent reveal pattern across Settings panels. The test regex was widened from `[\s\S]{0,1600}` to `[\s\S]{0,6000}` between the click-trash button and the inline confirm handle to accommodate the larger block in the same conditional ternary.

- **Replace `window.confirm()` with inline two-step confirmation** (`b1e4fc6`): The original delete handler popped a system `confirm()` dialog — jarring in an otherwise modern settings panel (drop-target depth tracking, byte-counted preview card, animated file-tree disclosure) and a pattern that no other settings panel in the app uses (`PhoneMirrorSettings`, `LocalWhisperModelPanel`, `AIProvidersSettings` all use either inline confirm or a soft-delete pattern). Fixed by replacing the system dialog with an inline two-step confirmation row:
  - **First click on the trash icon** → row enters "confirm mode". The trash icon is replaced inline with a `Cancel` button + a red `Delete this skill` button, with the skill name echoed next to them ("Delete code-simplifier?"). Both buttons are *always visible* (no hover-reveal) because the user has already committed to the action.
  - **Second click on the red Delete** → invokes `skillsDelete` IPC (with the per-skill `deletingIds` in-flight guard + banner hygiene from the senior review still in place).
  - **Escape key** dismisses the confirm — `useEffect` keydown listener attached only while `confirmingId` is non-null.
  - **6s auto-cancel** if the user walks away mid-confirm — `setTimeout` cleared on commit + on manual cancel, so a fast user never sees the row snap out of confirm mode unexpectedly.
  - **Only one row can be in confirm mode at a time** (single `confirmingId: string | null` state, not per-row booleans) — matches the user's mental model and prevents the visual confusion of two rows waiting simultaneously.
  - **`aria-live="polite"` on the confirm group** so screen readers announce the new controls when the row enters confirm mode. `role="group"` + `aria-label="Confirm delete <name>"` give explicit context.
  - **Per-button `disabled={deletingIds.has(skill.id)}`** during the actual delete + label flips to "Deleting…" so the user gets visual feedback that the action is in flight (closes the existing TOCTOU window between click and IPC return).
  - **Test surface updated** in `SkillsIpcWiring.test.mjs`: swapped the positive `window\.confirm\([^)]*Delete/` assertion for three — `doesNotMatch` on the system dialog, positive match for `confirmingId` state machinery, positive match for the "Delete this skill" inline button. `Trash2` lookahead relaxed from 1600 → 6000 chars to accommodate the larger inline confirm block nested under the same conditional. 21/21 pass.

- **Standardized the Built-in/Local badge position to match `AIProvidersSettings`** (`1ea78fa`): The badge had been moved twice in rapid succession (commit `fa27a87` placed it at the very left of the row, commit `b6a23fa` placed it after the `/id` slug in the left cluster) — both reasonable choices but neither rooted in a convention, so the user cycled through both. Final position is now **anchored to the standardized convention used by the closest analog in the app**: `AIProvidersSettings.tsx:1364-1370` (Ollama model list — name on the left, type pill anchored to the right edge before any actions). The badge moved to the first child of the right cluster, so the row shape is now identical for every row regardless of `skill.source` — the only difference between Built-in and Local rows is the presence of the hover-reveal delete slot. Putting the pill in the same slot across all settings panels means the user's eye can find it without re-learning the layout per panel. 21/21 node --test pass, tsc --noEmit clean.

- **Aligned the Built-in and Local badge x-position across rows** (`f0f1bfb`): Despite the standardization above, the badge still sat at different x-coordinates between rows because of (a) text-length differences ("Built-in" is 8 chars, "Local" is 5 chars) and (b) the hidden-but-layout-occupying trash icon (~30px + gap-1) pushing the Local badge leftward. Fixed with two parts: (1) `w-12 text-left` on the badge span so both texts start at the same left edge within the 48px badge slot, (2) `minWidth: 60px` inline-styled wrapper around the delete affordance so its layout space is reserved uniformly across every row (including built-ins where the actual button content is omitted). The visible badge now sits at the exact same x-coordinate in every row.

- **Removed the Built-in/Local badge entirely** (`3950df8`): Following a request — 'remove the local built in thing' — after 5 commit-cycles positioning the badge (left edge of row, after `/id`, right cluster matching `AIProvidersSettings`, then a same-x-coordinate alignment), the badge itself was removed. The functional distinction is still enforced at three layers: (1) UI gate (`{skill.source !== 'builtin' && ...}` hides the delete button on built-in rows), (2) server-side `SkillsManager.deleteSkill()` refusal with the "Built-in skills cannot be deleted" error, (3) `ensureBuiltinSkills()` would silently re-seed the folder anyway. After the removal, every row has the same right-side structure (empty for built-ins, hover-reveal delete for user-installed) — the visual asymmetry between the two row shapes is now the only indicator of which is which. The 60px slot reservation that anchored the badge x-coordinate was also removed (it existed solely to align the badge); the natural button width is stable without it.

### Crash & Launch Fixes (2026-07-06)

Black-screen and silent-crash debugging pass on the `hardening/v2.7.0` branch, traced from the user's `MEASURE_LATENCY=true npm start` log. Three distinct root causes, all fixed and verified via Chrome DevTools Protocol.

#### Critical

- **`electron:dev` npm script was missing the `build:electron` step**: A prior onboarding commit silently dropped `node scripts/build-electron.js` from the dev script, replacing it with `npm run build` (which only compiles the renderer). Without `build:electron`, `dist-electron/electron/main.js` was never produced, Electron's Node bootstrap threw `Cannot find module ...` on `require()` of the missing entry, and the process exited with code 1 and zero stdout/stderr — manifesting as "the app crashed with no error message." Script restored to `npm run build && npm run build:electron && cross-env NODE_ENV=development electron .` so both bundles are always present.

- **Black-screen from `.mjs`/`.ts` module-shadowing (Vite extension precedence)**: Latent module-resolution landmine that surfaced the instant the renderer was actually reachable. Vite's default extension order (`['.mjs', '.js', '.mts', '.ts', '.jsx', '.tsx', '.json']`) silently resolves any unqualified import (no extension) to the `.mjs`/`.js` twin of a `.ts`/`.tsx` basename — including no-op test stubs and stale manually-compiled copies. The actual trigger was `src/lib/onboarding/orchestrator.mjs` (a no-op test stub with a non-referentially-stable `getSnapshot()`) being picked over `orchestrator.ts` (the real `OnboardingOrchestrator`); feeding the unstable snapshot into React's `useSyncExternalStore` triggered "Maximum update depth exceeded" during the commit phase, unmounting the entire React tree, and leaving the window blank while the main-process log stayed completely green. Fixed all current instances and closed the whole bug class:
  - `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/onboarding/OrchestratedToasterHost.tsx`, `src/lib/onboarding/orchestrator.ts` — unqualified orchestrator / persistence imports now use explicit `.ts` extensions.
  - `src/components/NativelyInterface.tsx` — explicit `.ts` on the `rollingTranscriptState` import (was silently resolving to a stale hand-compiled `.js` sibling instead of the live `.ts` source).
  - `premium/src/RemoteCampaignToaster.tsx` — explicit `.ts` on the `useAdCampaigns` import.
  - `electron/utils/rollingTranscriptState.js` — deleted (stale committed build artifact; its only test consumer reads from `dist-electron/` output).
  - 11 stale `.js` build artifacts in `premium/src/` deleted (`JDAwarenessToaster.js`, `MaxUltraUpgradeToaster.js`, `ModesSettings.js`, `NativelyApiPromoToaster.js`, `NegotiationCoachingCard.js`, `PremiumPromoToaster.js`, `PremiumUpgradeModal.js`, `ProfileFeatureToaster.js`, `ProfileVisualizer.js`, `RemoteCampaignToaster.js`, `useAdCampaigns.js`) — zero live consumers; all references in `src/premium/index.tsx` already use fully-qualified `.tsx`/`.ts` globs.
  - `vite.config.mts` — added `resolve.extensions: ['.mts', '.ts', '.tsx', '.mjs', '.js', '.jsx', '.json']` so `.ts`/`.tsx` always win over `.js`/`.mjs` project-wide as one-line defense-in-depth.
  - `src/lib/onboarding/orchestrator.mjs` — hardened the no-op stub's `getSnapshot()` to return a single cached module-level snapshot (referentially stable across calls) so any future unqualified import that still hits the stub cannot trigger the React infinite-render cycle.

- **`src/main.tsx` referenced the undeclared global `process`**: `document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-platform', window.electronAPI?.platform ?? process?.platform ?? '')` ran at module top-level inside the renderer (`contextIsolation: true` / `nodeIntegration: false`). `process` isn't `undefined` here — it's literally undeclared — and optional chaining `?.` does not protect against referencing an undeclared identifier, so the line threw `ReferenceError: process is not defined` synchronously, aborted the module before `ReactDOM.createRoot(...).render(<App/>)`, and produced a black window with no renderer-side diagnostics. Replaced with `typeof process !== 'undefined' ? process.platform : ''` (the only safe check). Repo-wide sweep confirmed no other unguarded `process` / `require` / `__dirname` / `__filename` / `global` / `Buffer` references in `src/` or `premium/src/` (`process.env.NODE_ENV` hits are safe — Vite inlines them at build time).

#### Side effect (silent dead-code surfaced)

- **Onboarding orchestrator was silently `no-op`'d in the running app**: Before the module-shadowing fix, every `getOrchestrator()` call resolved to the `.mjs` stub, meaning the entire onboarding feature (permissions toaster, browser-extension toaster, profile/modes onboarding gates, trial promo, support/donation toaster, ad rotation gating, review prompt) had been wired up correctly in source but produced zero effects in the running app for weeks. It only became visible once `useSyncExternalStore` was introduced, which is why this "hardening" branch's headline onboarding feature had appeared to land cleanly while users never actually saw any of the toaster flows. Explicit-extension fix restores the real orchestrator in production.

### Local-Reranker SIGTRAP & Multi-ONNX Hardening (2026-07-06)

A 16 GB MacBook Air (`Mac16,12`) running live transcription + LLM streaming crashed with `SIGTRAP / EXC_BREAKPOINT` inside `onnxruntime::BFCArena::Extend → posix_memalign` in a Node.js `worker_threads.Worker`, traced through `InferenceSession::Run → ExecuteKernel → Add<float>::Compute → Tensor::Tensor → BFCArena::Alloc → CPUAllocator::Alloc → posix_memalign` (live crash report at `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/Electron-2026-07-06-034833.ips`). Root cause: the `ragLocalRerank` flag had been flipped to `default: true` (in `electron/intelligence/intelligenceFlags.ts:211`) while the bge-reranker-base cross-encoder model was **not yet bundled** — the cold-load + cold-inference of the 266 MB q8 ONNX model on a 16 GB box under peak multi-ONNX + LLM streaming pressure tripped `posix_memalign`. The reranker was the immediate trigger, but the underlying race surface (concurrent `InferenceSession::Run` calls contending for the native BFCArena) spans all four local ONNX consumers: `LocalEmbeddingProvider`, `LocalReranker`, `IntentClassifier`'s zero-shot worker, and Whisper's STT worker. A senior code review surfaced 2 CRITICALs, 2 HIGHs, and 7 MEDIUM/LOWs on the per-loader band-aid; all are addressed below. Net: 8 files modified + 3 new files; typecheck clean; existing hardening test suite (`OnnxWorkerIsolationHardening2026_07_05.test.mjs`) green; ~288 MB removed from the installer (reranker is now lazy-downloaded).

#### Critical

- **Shared cross-loader ONNX gate (`electron/utils/onnxThreadConfig.ts`)** — replaces the per-loader memory check that previously masked the reranker crash surface while leaving the multi-ONNX race intact. New exports:
  - `acquireOnnxSlot(priority?: 'normal' | 'high'): Promise<() => void>` — async semaphore with FIFO waiters. Default cap is **2 concurrent sessions** (`NATIVELY_ONNX_MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS`, live env re-read on every call); Whisper claims `'high'` priority so its streaming loop acquires before queued normal-priority consumers (RAG embeds, intent classification, rerank). Does **not** preempt a running session — only re-orders the waiters, so a session already executing will finish its current `Run()` cleanly.
  - `hasEnoughMemoryForOnnxSession(): boolean` — `os.freemem() / 1024^3 >= NATIVELY_ONNX_MIN_FREE_GB` (default `2.0` GB). Fails **open** if `os.freemem()` itself throws (rare sandboxed Linux configs).
  - `getMinFreeGBForOnnxSession()`, `getMaxConcurrentOnnxSessions()` — live env-aware getters for instrumentation and tests.
  - `__resetOnnxGateForTests()` — test-only reset of the in-flight counters + waiter queues.

  All four consumers (`LocalReranker`, `LocalEmbeddingProvider`, `IntentClassifier`, `LocalWhisperSTT` in both its cold-start path **and** the `modelPreloader` warm path) now `await acquireOnnxSlot(...)` + check `hasEnoughMemoryForOnnxSession()` before posting `init` to their worker, and release the slot in the worker's `error`/`exit` handlers (and `beginWorkerTermination` for Whisper's clean-shutdown path). A gate refusal is **non-fatal** everywhere — `LocalEmbeddingProvider` falls through to lexical retrieval, `IntentClassifier` falls to regex-only, `LocalReranker` returns `null` from `rerank()` (caller keeps the cosine top-K), `LocalWhisperSTT` stalls its streaming loop (which is already stall-tolerant via `pendingAudio` queue + backoff) and surfaces an error event so the UI can offer cloud STT. Critically, gate refusals do **not** latch the per-consumer `loadFailed` flag (which is reserved for actual load errors) — a later, less-pressured moment will retry automatically. Slot ownership transfers cleanly when `modelPreloader.takeWarmWorker(modelId)` hands a warm worker to `LocalWhisperSTT`: the preloader installs `__slotRelease` on the worker object, the consumer's own error/exit listeners release the slot via the same idempotent function (no double-release). The Whisper preloader silently skips on gate refusal (does **not** surface as a worker `error`, which would trigger `modelPreloader.ts:30`'s persisted 5-min failure cooldown and block future preloads of the same model).

- **Reranker lazy-download replaces the unconditional 283 MB bundle** — the bundled `resources/models/Xenova/bge-reranker-base/` directory has been deleted from the install (`extraResources` still ships `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` + `mobilebert-uncased-mnli`, both small + always used). The 266 MB q8 ONNX model now downloads on first document-grounded mode activation via the existing `LocalModelDownloadService` infrastructure. **NEW** files:
  - `electron/rag/rerankerDownloadProvider.ts` — provider factory mirroring `createWhisperDownloadProvider` (`LocalModelDownloadService.ts:617`); `name: 'reranker'`; `isModelCached` checks `<userData>/local-models/Xenova/bge-reranker-base/onnx/model_quantized.onnx` (zero-byte guard); `deletePartial` is a recursive `fs.rmSync` on the model dir; `spawnWorker` constructs a small dedicated download worker speaking the service's `progress`/`ready`/`error` protocol (NOT the reranker's `requestId`-based inference protocol — they're different workers); `buildInitMessage` returns `{ type: 'init', modelId, cacheDir, dtype: 'q8' }`. Cache directory resolution has a `HOME`-based fallback for `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` test/probe mode where `app.getPath('userData')` isn't ready.
  - `electron/rag/rerankerDownloadWorker.ts` — separate worker that loads the model via `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` + `AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained({ dtype: 'q8', progress_callback, session_options: getBoundedOnnxSessionOptions() })` and reports progress with byte-weighted aggregation across files. Uses the shared `getBoundedOnnxSessionOptions()` so the download itself can't pressure the BFCArena.

  Registered in `electron/main.ts` next to the whisper provider (in a try/catch — provider registration is non-fatal, so a missing `@huggingface/transformers` doesn't block app boot). `electron/services/ModesManager.ts:prewarmModeReferenceIndex` now branches: if `LocalReranker.isCached()` returns `true`, just `prewarm()` (existing path); if `false`, kick off `LocalModelDownloadService.getInstance().start('reranker', 'Xenova/bge-reranker-base#q8')` (idempotent — a parallel request from another mode activation just attaches to the same in-flight download). `LocalReranker.resolveModelPath()` now checks the user-data cache first, then bundled `process.resourcesPath/models` (legacy fallback for users with a prior v2.7.x bundle), then `app.getAppPath()/resources/models` at three relative depths — verified by the same `tokenizer.json` marker probe used in `LocalEmbeddingProvider.resolveModelPath`. `scripts/download-models.js` now **skips** the reranker download step entirely (was the bundle-source-of-truth) with a comment explaining the new lazy path.

#### High

- **Live env re-read for the memory floor** (`electron/utils/onnxThreadConfig.ts:readMinFreeGB`). The previous per-loader implementation captured the env var at module-load time (`const MIN_FREE_MEM_GB_FOR_RERANKER_LOAD = Number.parseFloat(...)`), breaking the sibling-flags convention where `readIntEnv('NATIVELY_ONNX_INTRA_OP_THREADS', ...)` re-reads on every call so a debug shortcut like `NATIVELY_RERANKER_MIN_FREE_GB=0.1` from the renderer console takes effect immediately. The shared gate re-reads on every `acquireOnnxSlot` / `hasEnoughMemoryForOnnxSession` call, matching the existing pattern. (Also: `>= 0` instead of `> 0` for the threshold so `0` disables the floor cleanly — the original `> 0` rejected `'0'` as invalid and silently fell back to the default `2.0` GB.)

- **`rag_rerank_unavailable` telemetry event** (`electron/services/modes/ModeHybridRetriever.ts`). When the reranker is requested (the `ragLocalRerank` flag is on, mode has reference files) but `LocalReranker.isAvailable()` returns `false`, emit a throttled (once per minute per process) telemetry event with `reason: 'not_cached' | 'load_failed' | 'unknown'`. This closes the silent-null-return failure mode where the reranker silently no-ops with no signal in telemetry — a single `rag_rerank_unavailable` event in the field would have surfaced the SIGTRAP root cause within one query rather than waiting for a stack-trace crash report. Telemetry never blocks the live answer path (guarded by an inner try/catch).

- **`LocalReranker.resolveModelPath()` mirrors `LocalEmbeddingProvider.resolveModelPath()`** — the same candidate-search pattern (env override, packaged `resourcesPath/models`, then `app.getAppPath()/resources/models` at three relative depths, with `tokenizer.json` as the existence marker) so the reranker works in every launch context (`electron .` from the repo, packaged prod, Playwright-driven `dist-electron/main.js`). Adds a `<userData>/local-models` candidate so the lazy-download cache is found. Falls back to `process.resourcesPath || appPath || process.cwd()` if nothing matches (worker gets *something* coherent, will try `local_files_only` in prod or `allowRemoteModels` in dev).

#### Medium / Low (driving test)

- `electron/rag/__tests__/OnnxWorkerIsolationHardening2026_07_05.test.mjs` — sets `process.env.NATIVELY_ONNX_MIN_FREE_GB = '0'` and `process.env.NATIVELY_ONNX_MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS = '99'` at the top of the file so the gate stays permissive during worker-isolation tests (these tests validate isolation, not the gate). Without this, the test environment's <2 GB free would refuse every load and the suite would fail on a permission error rather than testing what it's supposed to. All 4 suite tests pass.
- 15+ related tests pass with no regression: `HeuristicExtractor.test.mjs`, `HybridDocumentGroundingPath.test.mjs`, `KnowledgeOrchestratorIngest.test.mjs`, `LocalRerankerModel.test.mjs`.
- Standalone gate probe `/tmp/gate-probe.mjs` (not committed) verifies: gate basics, blocks at the cap and unblocks on release, respects priority (high blocked by normal queue), live env re-read on `hasEnoughMemoryForOnnxSession`, `isCached` returns false on empty cache + true on populated cache with HOME-fallback. All 4 sub-tests pass.
- Worker probe `/tmp/reranker-probe.mjs` (from earlier, before bundle was deleted) confirmed: 30-pair batch inference completes in 2195 ms with semantically correct scores — the same forward-pass shape that crashed the live app, but now running cleanly through the worker-thread isolation + bounded `getBoundedOnnxSessionOptions()` (intra/inter-op = 1).

#### Verified properties

- Crash forensics from `Electron-2026-07-06-034833.ips` — the worker is `WorkerThread` (Node's `worker_threads`, not an OS pthread spawned by ORT), so the crash was actually inside the `localRerankerWorker.ts:22-39` host. The gate closes that surface: at most 2 ONNX sessions alive simultaneously, and any session refused under `<2 GB` free memory falls back to non-ONNX behavior.
- `Mac16,12` (16 GB M4 Air) at the time of the crash had 7 worker threads + 59 total threads; current `vm_stat` shows ~185 MB free, well under the 2 GB floor — meaning on this machine, `LocalReranker.ensureLoaded()` would refuse the model load outright. The retriever falls through to cosine top-K ordering, the user sees correct retrieval, and the app stays alive.
- Bundle size: `resources/models/` was 518 MB → 230 MB after deletion (288 MB removed). On a packaged installer that's a ~280 MB download shrink for the >80% of users who never invoke a custom document-grounded mode.

### Known Follow-ups (not fixed in this pass)

The review surfaced pre-existing structural issues that this commit intentionally does **not** change. Flagged for a follow-up commit:

- `package.json` at repo root has no `devDependencies` block. `electron`, `@electron/rebuild`, `@types/electron`, `@types/ws`, `@types/better-sqlite3` are all missing, so `npm ci` does not install them and `tsc --noEmit` produces hundreds of phantom module-not-found errors. A fresh clone will break the rebuild step.
- No `preinstall` guard against running `npm install` under Rosetta on Apple Silicon — a future contributor would silently regress the native module ABI mismatch fixed here.
- No `scripts.build` at repo root. Build is invoked via `scripts/build-electron.js` + `vite build` directly. Worth adding for CI parity.

    ### Full-JIT Profile Intelligence Hardening (2026-07-08)

    Converts the profile-intelligence path from deterministic final-answer rendering to **deterministic evidence selection + provider-generated just-in-time (JIT) final answers**. The durable law: AOT/deterministic code may only select evidence, compute metadata, resolve source ownership, and build compact prompts — it must never emit a user-visible final profile answer. Every user-visible profile answer is now one of exactly four modes: `jit_llm`, `jit_llm_repaired`, `source_safe_refusal` (a source-switch/insufficient-source line with no profile facts), or `provider_error_no_answer` (a provider-failure line with no profile facts, never stored as authoritative memory). The forbidden paths — `atomic_deterministic`, `deterministic_fast_path`, `aot_final_answer`, `cached_final_answer`, `template_final_answer` — are eliminated from the user-visible answer.

    #### New modules

    - **`electron/llm/FinalAnswerGenerationPolicy.ts`** — the final-answer law. `evaluateFinalAnswerPolicy`, `assertNoForbiddenFinalAnswerPath`, `legacyFastPathToForbiddenPath`, `finalAnswerRequiresProvider`, and `decideSessionWritePolicy` (which returns `store_conversational_only` / `store_non_authoritative` / `do_not_store`). Rejects user-visible deterministic/template/cached answers and blocks SessionTracker storage for provider-error/no-answer, critical unrepaired validator failures, and source-contract failures.
    - **`electron/llm/ProfileJitPromptBuilder.ts`** — compact provider prompt builder. Emits the exact user question in a `<question trust="untrusted" data_only="true">` tag, a bounded `<allowed_evidence>` block with source labels/refs/confidence, a no-hallucination rule, and explicit missing-info/conflict instructions. Filters evidence by the source contract's `allowedSources` / `forbiddenSources`, and splits JD (target-role) evidence from resume (candidate) evidence into separate labelled blocks so a JD requirement can never be fused into claimed candidate experience.
    - **`electron/llm/sourceOwnership.ts`** — resolves `SourceOwner` (`profile` / `reference_files` / `transcript` / `mixed` / `unknown`) from active-mode source authority and profile policy. Explicit profile asks in reference-file/transcript-only modes become a source-switch clarification rather than a profile leak.

    #### Behavioral changes

    - **Evidence selectors, not answer builders**: `manualProfileIntelligence.ts` now exposes `selectManualProfileEvidence` returning evidence with no final `answer` string; `profileAnswerBackend.ts` exposes `buildManualProfileEvidenceRoute` (deprecated alias kept, evidence-only). `buildLiveFallbackAnswer` always returns `null`, so provider stalls can never fall back to canned profile prose.
    - **Manual chat (`gemini-chat-stream`)** plans the answer, resolves source ownership, selects evidence only when ownership permits, prepends a compact JIT prompt, and streams the final answer from the provider. Deterministic profile prose is no longer streamed on the fast path, provider-outage repair, sanitizer repair, or assistant-voice-misfire repair — those emit source-safe/provider-error lines instead.
    - **WTA (What-to-Answer)** identity fallback now grounds on selected JIT evidence rather than `<candidate_identity_fact>` prose; the deterministic live fallback is removed.
    - **Staged source-owner enforcement** via `NATIVELY_SOURCE_OWNER_ENFORCEMENT_STAGE` (`off` / `observe` / `soft_block` / `enforce`), consumed at the manual + WTA ownership gates: `off` restores the legacy permissive guard (opt-in only), every other stage honors the resolver, so live behavior is enforce-by-default and leak-safe.
    - **Hindsight recall** is now owner-gated (permitted only for `mixed`/`transcript` owners; blocked for `reference_files`/`profile`/`unknown`) and wrapped in a `<long_term_memory trust="low" authority="non_authoritative">` envelope. Prior assistant responses are continuity/referent-only, never source evidence.
    - **SessionTracker writes** are gated by the write policy on both the manual completion store (including `logUsage` + `conversationMemoryV2` record) and the WTA path (`addAssistantMessage` + `pushUsage`), so provider-error/no-answer artifacts never become authoritative memory or land in the saved meeting's usage.

    #### Tests

    New: `FinalAnswerGenerationPolicy.test.mjs`, `ProfileJitPromptBuilder.test.mjs`, `SourceOwnerEnforcement.test.mjs`. Rewritten evidence-only: `manualProfileIntelligence.test.mjs`, `profileAnswerBackend.test.mjs`. Updated: `CustomModeSourceIsolation2026_07_06.test.mjs`. Focused suites pass 37/37, source isolation passes 37/37 in `NATIVELY_SOURCE_OWNER_ENFORCEMENT_STAGE=enforce`, full `tsc --noEmit` clean. Two code-reviewer passes closed 1 CRITICAL (inert session-write gate on the main completion store) + 4 lower-severity findings (dead staged-enforcement accessor, ungated Hindsight recall, WTA `pushUsage` store-gate asymmetry, profile-evidence double-injection). See `docs/PROFILE_INTELLIGENCE_FULL_JIT_POLICY.md` and `docs/PROFILE_INTELLIGENCE_FULL_JIT_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-07-08

Startup-crash hardening follow-up to v2.8.0. The v2.8.0 build never crashed, but it shipped **without a published `latest-mac.yml`** (no `v2.8.0` git tag was ever pushed, so `release-macos.yml` never ran), the `update-available` handler had no version guard, and the app had zero crash/quit observability — every `before-quit` cleanup looked identical to an OS-reaped crash. Plus four latent issues that previously fired on every fresh install: noisy `vec0 constructor error` from a broken sqlite-vec migration, `onnxruntime-common` was a transitive-only dep, Ollama was force-spawned regardless of user selection, and ENOENT noise every retry.

### Auto-updater safety

- **`AppState.isRealUpgrade(current, remote)` gates the production updater path** (`electron/main.ts`). Strips `v` prefix and pre-release suffix, parses strictly `X[.Y[.Z[.B]]]`, returns strict greater-than. The `update-available` handler now silently demotes non-upgrades (downgrade, equal, malformed) to `update-not-available { ignored: true, reason: 'non-upgrade', remote }` — never broadcasts the update UI, never queues a download. The `quitAndInstallUpdate()` path is also gated, so a stray renderer/UI call can't apply a downgrade. New startup log: `currentVersion=… channel=… feed=…` so a mis-pointed `latest.yml` is immediately diagnosable from the log. 8 unit tests (`electron/update/AppState.isRealUpgrade.test.mjs`) including the exact v2.7.0-vs-2.8.0 prod repro.

### ONNX runtime packaging

- **`onnxruntime-common` promoted to a direct `dependencies` entry** (`package.json`). It was a transitive-only dep of `onnxruntime-node`; a packaging pass that strips non-direct deps would have produced the exact `Cannot find package 'onnxruntime-common' imported from … app.asar.unpacked/node_modules/@huggingface/transformers/dist/transformers.node.mjs` failure from the user log. Pinned to `1.22.0` to match `onnxruntime-node`'s declared peer for ABI parity.
- **New `scripts/smoke-onnx-packaging.mjs`** (`npm run smoke:onnx-packaging`). Eight assertions: all three packages (`onnxruntime-{node,common}`, `@huggingface/transformers`) resolve from the packaged-app context, both are declared direct deps, ABI versions match, and `asarUnpack` includes the four required globs. Runs in <100 ms with no Electron boot.

### Ollama optionality & non-fatal spawning

- **`bootstrapOllamaEmbeddings` now consults `SettingsManager` for an explicit opt-out** (`electron/main.ts`). `disableOllamaBootstrap: true`, `localProvider: 'none'`, or `localProvider: 'cloud'` short-circuits the bootstrap with a clear log line, so a fresh install on a user who never selected Ollama no longer triggers `spawn('ollama', ['serve'])`.
- **`OllamaBootstrap.ensureOllamaRunning` throttles the ENOENT noise** (`electron/rag/OllamaBootstrap.ts`). A `MISSING_BACKOFF_MS = 60_000` per-process flag means the "Ollama binary not on PATH; skipping spawn" log line fires at most once per minute per process instead of every retry. The pre-existing `useOllama` gate on `forceRestartOllama` (added 2026-07-07) is unchanged.

### sqlite-vec v3/v4 — silent on fresh install

- **Migrations v2→v3 and v3→v4 are now no-op on the happy path** (`electron/db/DatabaseManager.ts`). The historical SQL `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE vec_chunks USING vec0(..., embedding float)` (no dimension) was rejected by sqlite-vec on every fresh install with `vec0 constructor error: At least one vector column is required`. New `tryProvisionLegacyVecTables()` probes `sqlite_master` for orphan `vec_chunks` / `vec_summaries` from prior broken installs and DROPs them only if they exist, bumping a `_lastLegacyCleanup` counter. The v3/v4 migration blocks only log when that counter is non-zero. A clean fresh install now produces **zero log lines** for v3/v4 (was 2 errors + 1 warning). `user_version` still advances normally, so users mid-migration are unaffected.

### Crash / quit observability

- **New `electron/utils/lifecycleTracker.ts`** wires the previously-missing `will-quit`, `render-process-gone`, `child-process-gone`, and `gpu-process-crashed` handlers, plus a tagged `QuitReason` enum (`user-quit`, `window-close`, `updater-quit-install`, `manual-relaunch`, `fatal-main-error`, `renderer-gone`, `child-process-gone`, `gpu-process-crashed`, `os-signal`, `unknown`). The marker persists as `lifecycle-marker.json` in `userData/`. `setQuitReason(reason, meta)` is called before `autoUpdater.quitAndInstall`, the native-arch-gate fatal path, and any main-process crash; `markCleanExit()` is called at the end of `before-quit` cleanup so a Cmd+Q leaves the marker in `lastEvent='clean-exit'` / `quitReason=null`.
- **`installBeforeReady(consoleLog)` static method** wires `uncaughtException`, `unhandledRejection`, and `SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP` on `process` (not `app`). Called from `nativeArchGate.ts` as the very first thing its IIFE does, so a crash during native-binding dlopen — before `app.whenReady()` ever fires — still writes a marker to `os.tmpdir()/natively-lifecycle-${pid}.json`. The full `install()` (called from `main.ts` after the `second-instance` handler but before `whenReady()`) wires the `app.on(...)` handlers and is idempotent with `installBeforeReady`.
- **Next-launch crash detection**: `didPreviousSessionCrash()` reads the durable `userData` marker (tmpdir fallback markers are process-scoped and OS-cleared, so they don't help cross-launch detection). Returns true for any `quitReason` other than `user-quit` / `window-close`, plus the SIGKILL signature (`quitReason: null` AND `lastEvent !== 'clean-exit'`). On boot, `main.ts` logs `[Lifecycle] previous session ended unexpectedly: pid=… lastEvent=… reason=…` so the next user bug report starts with a known quit reason.
- **Meta sanitizer** strips `key|secret|token|password|auth|credential` fields from any object passed to `setQuitReason()` — a future maintainer can't accidentally log credentials, transcripts, or screenshots into the marker.

### Release gate / CI

- **New `scripts/release-gate.mjs`** (`npm run release-gate`) — 8 assertions that must all pass before tagging:
  1. `package.json#version` is well-formed semver.
  2. **Latest `v*` git tag ≤ current version** (the exact failure that caused v2.8.0 to ship without a published `latest-mac.yml`; the gate's error message names this explicitly: *"no v* git tags found. Tag the release with `git tag v${current}` before publishing — otherwise `latest-mac.yml` on GitHub Releases will keep pointing at the previous version"*). Hotfix bypass: `NATIVELY_ALLOW_UNTAGGED_RELEASE=1`.
  3. Delegates to `smoke:onnx-packaging`.
  4. `DatabaseManager.ts` contains no active reference to the broken `embedding float` vec0 schema.
  5. `LifecycleTracker.getInstance().install(...)` is wired in `main.ts`.
  6. `bootstrapOllamaEmbeddings` has the cloud-key skip guard.
  7. `isRealUpgrade(` is wired into the updater.
  8. Packaged `app-update.yml` (when present) points at `github/Natively-AI-assistant/natively-cluely-ai-assistant/release`.

### Verification

`npm run typecheck:electron` clean; 19 new tests in `AppState.isRealUpgrade.test.mjs` (8) + `lifecycleTracker.test.mjs` (11, including 2 for the tmpdir fallback when `userData` throws); the pre-existing `electron/update/**/*.test.mjs` (10/10) and `NewUserPcHardening2026_07_07.test.mjs` (5/5 Ollama regressions) still pass. `npm run smoke:onnx-packaging` and `npm run release-gate` both green.

### Ship checklist for this release

1. Confirm `git tag v2.8.1` is pushed and `release-macos.yml` published a fresh `latest-mac.yml` / `latest.yml` to GitHub Releases.
2. Run `npm run release-gate` locally.
3. Install the produced `Natively-2.8.1-arm64.dmg` on a clean macOS profile and walk the 8-step manual QA (clean install no Ollama spawn noise, Settings AI Providers Ollama section "Not installed" without spam, sign in to a cloud provider and confirm RAG tab shows "Embeddings ready" without any Ollama attempt, manual Check-for-Updates returns `Update not available: 2.8.1`, `kill -9` then relaunch surfaces the "previous session ended unexpectedly" warning).

    - **State Synchronization**: Greatly improved internal state synchronization across all application windows (Settings, Launcher, Overlay).

    ### Fixes

    - **Infinite Feedback Loops**: Completely eliminated the bug where toggling Undetectable mode would sometimes cause the app to rapidly toggle itself on and off.
    - **Delayed Dock Reappearance**: Fixed a regression where the macOS dock icon would mysteriously reappear several seconds after entering stealth mode if a disguise had recently been changed.
    - **Initial State Loading**: Fixed an issue where the Settings UI would briefly show incorrect toggle states when first opened.
    - **macOS OS-level Events**: Hardened the app against macOS `activate` events (like clicking the app in Finder) accidentally breaking stealth mode.

    ### Technical

    - Refactored IPC (Inter-Process Communication) listeners for `SettingsPopup` and `SettingsOverlay` to use a strict one-way (receive-only) data binding pattern.
    - Added strict management and cancellation of `forceUpdate` timeouts during stealth mode transitions.
    - Added explicit type safety for the new getters in `electron.d.ts`.

    ## [2.0.4] - 2026-03-14

    ### Summary

    Version 2.0.4 introduces a massive architectural overhaul to the native audio pipeline, guaranteeing production-ready stability, true zero-allocation data transfer, and instantaneous STT responsiveness with WebRTC ML-based VAD.

    ### What's New

    - **Two-Stage Silence Processing**: Replaced basic RMS noise gating with a two-stage pipeline combining an adaptive RMS threshold and WebRTC Machine Learning VAD. Rejects typing, fan noise, and non-speech sounds before they bill STT APIs.
    - **Zero-Copy ABI Transfers**: Transitioned the `ThreadsafeFunction` bridging to direct `napi::Buffer` (Uint8Array) allocations, completely eliminating V8 garbage collection pressure during continuous capture.
    - **Sliding-Window RAG**: Implemented a 50-token semantic overlap in `SemanticChunker.ts` to prevent conversational context loss across chunk boundaries.

    ### Improvements

    - **Latency & Responsiveness Tuning**: Stripped redundant TS debouncing, slashed `MIN_BUFFER_BYTES`, and reduced native hangover, achieving a ~300ms reduction in end-to-end transcription latency. short utterances ("Yes", "Stop") no longer sit trapped in the buffer.
    - Removed floating-point division truncation for superior downsampling from 44.1kHz external microphones.

    ### Fixes

    - Fixed a critical bug where the native Rust monitor returned a hardcoded `16000Hz` while actually streaming 48kHz audio. Now syncs true hardware sample rates.
    - Resolved the "Input missing" silent crash bug on microphone restarts by properly recreating the CPAL stream.
    - Restored the 10s continuous speech backstop for REST APIs to prevent unbounded buffer growth.
    - Added missing `notifySpeechEnded()` properties and cleaned up dangerous type casts.

    ### Technical

    - Audio processing transitioned entirely to strict ABI memory bridging (`napi::Buffer`)
    - Re-architected native silence_suppression state machine around WebRTC VAD inputs.

    ## [2.0.3] - 2026-03-13

    ### What's New

    - **Dynamic AI Model Selection:** Replaced static model lists with dynamic dropdowns. Your preferred models synced from providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) now automatically appear across the entire app.
    - **Multimodal Resilience:** Added a "Smart Dynamic Fallback" using Groq Llama 4 Scout. If default vision models fail or get rate-limited during screen analysis, Natively instantly reroutes the image to ensure uninterrupted performance.
    - **Multiple Screenshot Support:** The Natively Interface can now handle and process multiple attached screenshots simultaneously instead of just one.
    - **Improved Settings UX:** API keys now auto-save after 5 seconds of inactivity, and selecting a preferred model immediately updates the rest of the application without requiring a page reload.

    ### Architecture & Fixes

    - **Better Embeddings:** Migrated from Gemini Embedding to a completely new and more robust embedding architecture.
    - **Claude Fixes:** Resolved max_tokens and context limits issues specific to Anthropic Claude interactions.
    - **DRY Refactoring:** Centralized model configuration strings across the codebase to ensure easier future updates.
