/**
 * electron-builder.signed.cjs — PRODUCTION (Developer ID + notarization) build config.
 *
 * Used ONLY by `npm run app:build:signed` / `npm run dist:signed` via
 * `electron-builder --config electron-builder.signed.cjs`.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE FILE (not editing package.json `build`):
 *   The default `package.json` `build.mac` keeps `identity: null`, which makes
 *   electron-builder SKIP application signing on the default/dev path (only the
 *   ad-hoc afterPack signer runs). Removing `identity` from package.json would
 *   trigger electron-builder's arm64 "fall back to ad-hoc" path and double-sign
 *   the dev build. Keeping production signing in this opt-in file means the default
 *   build is byte-for-byte unchanged, and real signing/notarization is explicit.
 *
 * SIGNING + NOTARIZATION (electron-builder built-in, electron-builder 26):
 *   - identity        : Developer ID Application (auto-discovered, or NATIVELY_SIGN_IDENTITY/CSC_NAME)
 *   - hardenedRuntime : true  (REQUIRED for notarization)
 *   - entitlements    : build/entitlements.mac.plist (top-level)
 *   - entitlementsInherit : build/entitlements.mac.inherit.plist (helpers)
 *   - notarize: true  → electron-builder runs notarytool (@electron/notarize) and staples.
 *                       It deep-signs the app, frameworks, helpers, and native .node/.dylib
 *                       inside-out automatically, then submits + staples.
 *
 * DMG: electron-builder's own DMG-creation corrupts the embedded app signature
 *   (Apple notary log: "The signature of the binary is invalid" on the inner
 *   Natively executable). So we build ONLY the `zip` target with electron-builder
 *   (zip preserves signatures + is the auto-updater artifact), and the
 *   afterAllArtifactBuild hook rebuilds the styled DMGs from the pristine signed
 *   .app via create-dmg, then notarizes + staples them. See scripts/afterAllArtifactBuild.cjs.
 *
 *   Notarization credentials use the macOS keychain profile `natively-notary`
 *   (created via `xcrun notarytool store-credentials`). No plaintext Apple password
 *   lives in source — the secret is in the keychain; only the profile NAME and the
 *   (non-secret) Team ID are referenced here. electron-builder's getNotarizeOptions
 *   reads APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE for the keychain strategy.
 *
 * See docs/engineering/MACOS_SIGNING_NOTARIZATION_CHECKLIST.md and apple-signing-report.md.
