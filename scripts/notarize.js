/**
 * notarize.js — electron-builder `afterSign` hook (ACTIVE production path).
 *
 * This is the wired `afterSign` hook for electron-builder.signed.cjs, which now
 * sets `mac.notarize: false` so electron-builder does NOT run its own built-in
 * notarize+staple. We do it here instead, because we need a STAPLE RETRY:
 *
 *   THE Error 65 STAPLE RACE:
 *   `notarytool --wait` (and @electron/notarize's submit-and-wait) returns once
 *   Apple has DECIDED the verdict, but the notarization TICKET is published to
 *   Apple's CDN slightly later. `xcrun stapler staple` fetches that ticket — so a
 *   staple fired immediately after the verdict frequently fails with:
 *     CloudKit query … "Record not found" → The staple and validate action failed! Error 65.
 *   @electron/notarize staples exactly once with no retry, so this CDN lag was
 *   failing the entire signed build even though notarization SUCCEEDED.
 *
 *   FIX: we let @electron/notarize do the (robust) zip-and-submit + first staple
 *   attempt, but if that first staple hits the propagation race, we recover with
 *   scripts/staple-with-retry.js (exponential backoff) instead of failing the build.
 *
 * DMGs are still produced + notarized + stapled by scripts/afterAllArtifactBuild.cjs.
 *
 * Submits the freshly code-signed .app to Apple's notary service (notarytool)
 * and staples the resulting ticket to the bundle. @electron/notarize v3 performs
 * BOTH the submit-and-wait and the staple in one call.
 *
 * SAFETY / NON-BREAKING CONTRACT:
 *   - No-op on non-macOS.
 *   - No-op when notarization credentials are absent (local / dev / ad-hoc builds).
 *     This means `npm run app:build` (the ad-hoc dev path) is completely unaffected —
 *     it never tries to notarize and never fails for lack of an Apple account.
 *   - No-op when NATIVELY_SKIP_NOTARIZE=1 is set (explicit escape hatch).
 *   - Notarization only runs when one of the three credential strategies is fully
 *     configured via environment variables (see below). This is the production path.
 *
 * Credential strategies (pick ONE; checked in this order):
 *   1) App Store Connect API key (recommended for CI):
 *        APPLE_API_KEY       = absolute path to the .p8 key file
 *        APPLE_API_KEY_ID    = key id (e.g. T9GPZ92M7K)
 *        APPLE_API_ISSUER    = issuer UUID (team keys)
 *      If APPLE_API_KEY names a file that does not exist, this strategy is SKIPPED
 *      (with a loud warning) rather than selected — see resolveCredentials().
 *   2) Apple ID + app-specific password:
 *        APPLE_ID                      = your Apple Developer login email
 *        APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD   = app-specific password (NOT your Apple ID password)
 *        APPLE_TEAM_ID                 = 10-char Team ID
 *   3) Stored keychain profile (created via `xcrun notarytool store-credentials`):
 *        APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE        = profile name
 *        APPLE_KEYCHAIN                = (optional) keychain path
 *
 * We never log secret values — only which strategy was selected.
