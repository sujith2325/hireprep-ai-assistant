// electron/context-intelligence/retrieval/legacy-adapter.ts
//
// Phase 5 — adapter from the EXISTING storage/retrieval output into the V3
// evidence contract.
//
// SCOPE NOTE: the owner chose "decision + orchestration layer only", so
// ingestion, embeddings, VectorStore and chunking are reused as-is. Phase 5 is
// therefore NOT a schema rewrite — it is this adapter plus two additive type
// widenings. See 08_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §2.
//
// The two widenings this file performs, and why each is load-bearing:
//
//  1. scopeId  — EvidenceItem has none today (F19), so user/meeting/version
//     isolation cannot be ASSERTED on evidence, only inferred from which
//     retriever happened to run. Phase 2 measured a 54.8% stale-version
//     retrieval rate, so this is the single most consequential missing field.
//
//  2. answerabilityScore / rerankScore — ModeHybridRetriever COMPUTES these on
//     its internal ChunkCandidate and then DROPS them at the ModeRetrievedChunk
//     boundary. Structural and property-aware matching is calculated and thrown
//     away before any consumer can see it. Carrying them through is free: the
//     values already exist at the return site.
