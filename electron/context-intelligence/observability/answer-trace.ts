// electron/context-intelligence/observability/answer-trace.ts
//
// One structured trace per turn.
//
// WHY THIS IS THE FIRST ARCHITECTURAL DELIVERABLE
// The brief (§25.3) puts surface migration first. That is not executable here:
// of the three legacy decision layers, only ONE produces a structured object
// (resolveCanonicalTurn, with a single call site). The other two produce nothing
// comparable. So shadow mode (§25.2) has nothing to diff and cross-surface
// parity (§21.4) has nothing to compare — which is precisely how previous fix
// rounds passed their own tests without improving production behaviour.
//
// Everything downstream — parity, shadow mode, acceptance gates, legacy removal
// — depends on this existing FIRST, retrofitted to the legacy layers.
//
// PRIVACY: this trace carries evidence IDENTITY, never evidence CONTENT.
// See docs/context-intelligence-v3/12_ROLLOUT_AND_ROLLBACK.md §4.
