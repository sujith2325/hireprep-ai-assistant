//
// Outbound provider-data-scope enforcement for Context Intelligence V3.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// Settings > AI Providers > Privacy offers six "Cloud provider data scopes"
// toggles. Before this module the enforcement lived entirely in LLMHelper and
// keyed off LEGACY prompt tags (`<reference_file>`, `<candidate_…>`,
// `<meeting_history>`). V3 packs every source as
// `<evidence … source_type="…">`, so a V3-composed prompt matched none of them:
// no scope was ever inferred, nothing was ever withheld, and the
// "[ScopeFallback] … omitting from context" log line asserted a removal that
// never happened.
//
// The fix has to happen HERE, before packContext, not at the transport. The
// composer writes its instructions against the evidence set it is given — the
// checked-absence contract, the precedence contract, the "no evidence" wording.
// Stripping evidence downstream of the composer leaves a prompt whose
// instructions describe material the model can no longer see, which is a
// fabrication engine in a repository with this fabrication history. Filter
// first, compose against what survived.
//
// NEVER CACHE THE POLICY. esbuild inlines every module into each entry bundle
// (see scripts/build-electron.js: every .ts is an entry point), so a cached
// policy would go stale in every bundle except the one that wrote it — the
// exact trap that caused the 2026-07-31 cross-mode retrieval defect.
// SettingsManager itself is anchored on globalThis, so the live read below is
// one truth across all bundles.

/**
 * SourceType → the privacy toggle that governs sending it to a cloud provider.
 *
 * Continuity with the pre-V3 meaning of each toggle is the tie-breaker: the
 * legacy inference mapped `<candidate_*>` / `<user_context>` / `<meeting_history>`
 * to profile_history and `<reference_file>` to reference_files, so résumé and
 * profile facts stay on profile_history and uploaded documents stay on
 * reference_files. A user must be able to predict what a toggle does from its
 * label; a source type therefore maps to exactly ONE scope. (A "withhold if ANY
 * related scope is denied" fan-out was considered and rejected: it would make
 * reference_files=off silently disable the Profile Intelligence résumé, which
 * no user could predict from the UI.)
 *
 * JOB_DESCRIPTION is the one genuinely unsettled entry — legacy emitted it as
 * `<target_job_evidence>`, which NO legacy pattern matched, so there is no
 * continuity to preserve. It is filed under reference_files because it is an
 * uploaded document describing an external role, not the user's own history.
 *
 * Two scopes have no member here on purpose:
 *   • post_call_summary — produced by MeetingPersistence, never V3 evidence.
 *   • embeddings        — a retrieval-time concern (EmbeddingProviderResolver),
 *                         not a payload class.
