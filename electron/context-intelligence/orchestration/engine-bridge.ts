// One adoption point for the IntelligenceEngine surfaces.

// WHY A SHARED BRIDGE
// Five engine surfaces — assist, clarify, brainstorm, code-hint and manual
// answer — construct NO source authority whatsoever today. Each passes a raw
// `session.getFormattedContext(N)` blob straight to the model. Wiring them one
// at a time would recreate the very thing F2 describes: several near-identical
// decision sites drifting apart. There is exactly one here.
//
// Returns null whenever the flag is off or anything goes wrong, so a caller's
// integration is a two-line change and the failure mode is "legacy behaviour",
// never "no answer".
