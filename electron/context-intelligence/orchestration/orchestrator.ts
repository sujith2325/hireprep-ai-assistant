  // Satisfaction is judged per SUBJECT, not per claim requirement.
  //
  // A subject is one thing the user asked about — a clause. The classifier often
  // emits several claim types for a single clause because the MODE authorizes
  // several source types that could answer it: "Who owns the events table
  // migration?" in team-meet mode yields both MEETING_STATEMENT and
  // DOCUMENT_FACT. Those are ALTERNATIVES (either a transcript or a reference
  // document answers it), not a conjunction.
  //
  // Counting them as a conjunction made PARTIAL structurally unavoidable for that
  // whole class: the transcript supported MEETING_STATEMENT, no reference document
  // supported DOCUMENT_FACT, and a fully-answered question reported PARTIAL
  // (measured on H-02 and H-04). Grouping by subject keeps genuine multi-part
  // questions strict — "tell me about PriceX AND explain how WebRTC works" is two
  // distinct subjects and still requires both — while letting one clause be
  // satisfied by any authoritative route to it.
  // …with ONE refinement (2026-07-31): claims about the USER and claims about
  // the JOB on the SAME clause are a COMPARISON, not alternatives. "Do I meet
  // the two-year experience requirement?" emits USER_SKILL (the résumé side)
  // and JOB_REQUIRED_SKILL (the JD side) from one clause; the JD is PROHIBITED
  // from evidencing the user claim and vice versa, so neither can substitute
  // for the other — grouping them together let résumé evidence alone report
  // FULL with the requirement never retrieved (measured: the 2-year question
  // planned only JOB_DESCRIPTION and compared nothing). Claims within one
  // family remain alternatives, which is what H-02/H-04 established.
  //
  // The conjunction applies ONLY to claims whose authoritative source the turn
  // actually PLANS. A claim no planned source can ever satisfy (JOB vocabulary
  // in team-meet, which authorizes no JD at all) folds back into the base
  // family as an alternative — otherwise a fully-answered meeting question
  // that merely contains the word "required" reports structural PARTIAL

  // an answer drew on two files.

  // A real conflict is the SAME source appearing at two different versions.
  // Scope/version filtering should already make that unreachable, so this is an
  // assertion surface: if it ever fires, the filter has a hole.
  //
  // This compares `retrievedVersionId` — the version each chunk actually came

  // latter made the check dead code: the adapter stamps every admitted item with
  // the active version, so two items from one source could not differ, and the
  // "assertion surface" above could never fire no matter how broken the filter
  // was. The one hole that does exist — an unknown chunk version being assumed
  // current — is now an opt-in (`assumeCurrentWhenVersionUnknown`), and it is
  // exactly the configuration in which this check earns its place.
  //
  // NOT IMPLEMENTED: content-level contradiction ("v1 says 4 engineers, v2 says
  // 11") between two CURRENT sources. That needs value extraction and comparison
  // per claim. Reporting a conflict we cannot actually detect would be worse than
  // reporting none — §16.1 requires identifying the conflicting VALUES, not
  // merely asserting one exists. So version conflicts are resolved by the filter
  // (06_SOURCE_AUTHORITY_SPEC §3.2, newer wins) and CONFLICTING is reserved for a
