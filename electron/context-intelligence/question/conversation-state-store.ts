// electron/context-intelligence/question/conversation-state-store.ts
//
// The process-wide home for V3 conversation state.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// conversation-state.ts shipped complete and tested with ZERO production
// callers — question-resolver lowered confidence on follow-ups "expecting the
// caller to resolve against conversation state", and no caller did. The live
// result, measured across four modes in one session: "Why not?" produced a
// clarification about the wrong turn, "Can you explain it generally instead?"
// lost its referent entirely. The module worked; nothing fed it.
//
// WHY globalThis
// Same rule as ModesManager's active-mode snapshot and the answer-policy
// store: esbuild inlines this module per entry bundle, and harness runs
// co-load bundles. State written by one copy must be visible to every copy.
//
// BOUNDED BY CONSTRUCTION
// One ConversationState per session key, hard cap on sessions, oldest evicted.
// Prior answers are stored only as capped SUMMARIES (MAX_SUMMARY_CHARS) — a
// referent aid, never evidence (§12.3).
