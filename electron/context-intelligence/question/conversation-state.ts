// Compact, SCOPED follow-up continuity.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES
// Today five of nine surfaces pass `session.getFormattedContext(N)` — an
// unbounded transcript blob that also contains the assistant's own prior output
// labelled only as "ASSISTANT (PREVIOUS SUGGESTION)". A guard for that exists
// (context-os/assistantClaims) but is wired to ONE surface and disabled in
// production, so on the rest a single fabrication becomes self-reinforcing.
//
// Two rules follow, and both are enforced here rather than in a prompt:
//   1. State is SIZE-BOUNDED and reset on meeting change (§12.3).
//   2. Prior assistant output is a REFERENT, never evidence. It can tell you what
//      "it" refers to; it can never support a factual claim.
