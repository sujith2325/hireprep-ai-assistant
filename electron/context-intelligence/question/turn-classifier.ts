// Decides WHAT a turn is asking and WHETHER retrieval should run at all.
//
// WHY THIS LIVES ABOVE RETRIEVAL
// Phase 2 measured that every retrieval configuration returns a ranked pool for
// EVERY question — including "What is idempotency?". The retriever has no notion
// of "should I run"; it always produces output. So the fast/grounded decision
// cannot live inside retrieval and must be made here, before it.
//
// DETERMINISTIC BY DESIGN
// §32.7 forbids using an LLM for deterministic policy decisions without evidence
// that it improves quality, and §22.6 forbids an expensive multi-agent router on
// every uncertain question. This classifier is pure, synchronous and testable —
// which also means a misclassification is reproducible rather than stochastic.
