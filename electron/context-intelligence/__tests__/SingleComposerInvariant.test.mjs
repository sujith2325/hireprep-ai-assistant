// Phase 9 §28 regression guard — ONE prompt composer, permanently.
//
// The investigation found two composers: electron/llm/promptComposer.ts
// (complete, tested, ZERO importers) and the V3 composer. The removal matrix
// §2.1 stated the rule — "either wire it or delete it; what must not persist is
// a third composer" — Phase 4 chose the V3 one, and Phase 9 deleted the other.
//
// This test is what stops the pattern returning. It fails if a second composer
// reappears, or if the surviving one loses its call sites and becomes the same
// unreachable code the mission exists to eliminate.
