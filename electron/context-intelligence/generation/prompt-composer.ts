// electron/context-intelligence/generation/prompt-composer.ts
//
// THE canonical prompt composer. One implementation.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// F10: the repository already contains a composer (`electron/llm/promptComposer.ts`)
// with ZERO call sites, plus PromptAssemblerV2 and a context-os promptRenderer,
// both flag-off. Meanwhile ELEVEN independent sites emit profile/resume/JD blocks
// directly into provider-bound strings, four of them hardcoding the same
// <candidate_profile> literal with no shared constant.
//
// So the defect is not that composition is missing — it is that composition is
// everywhere. This module is only worth anything if it becomes the single site.
//
// SECTION ORDER IS PART OF THE CONTRACT (§19): permanent safety rules first so
// nothing later in the prompt can appear to supersede them, evidence late and
// explicitly framed as untrusted data.
