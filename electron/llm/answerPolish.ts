// FINAL-BOUNDARY ANSWER POLISH + DIVERSITY GUARD (manual regression 2026-06-12).
//
// Two real-session product-feel failures live here:
//   1. EMPTY BULLET MARKERS — models emit "* " lines with no content; the
//      streaming path has no markdown post-processing, so lone "*" lines reach
//      the UI. cleanAnswerArtifacts() runs at the final-answer boundary (cheap,
//      regex-only) and never touches code blocks.
//   2. REPEATED ANSWERS — over a 200-question session the same intro/scaffold/
//      first-sentence reappears across unrelated prompts and reads as canned.
//      AnswerDiversityGuard keeps the last N answer fingerprints per session
//      and classifies a new answer as repeated (same first sentence, same
//      visible template labels, near-duplicate token overlap). Callers use the
//      verdict to pick an alternate deterministic variant or run one short
//      LLM repair ("rewrite naturally, don't reuse the previous shape").
//
// Pure logic, no I/O, no LLM — callers own any regeneration.
