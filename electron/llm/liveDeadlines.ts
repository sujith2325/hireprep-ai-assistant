// Single source of truth for the LIVE-COPILOT latency contract (Issue 1, P0).
// What-to-answer and live manual chat must NEVER make the user wait 10s+ or show
// an empty answer. These budgets are shared by IntelligenceEngine (WTA),
// ipcHandlers (manual chat), and the benchmark runners so the product and its
// measurement agree exactly.
//
// The mechanism that ENFORCES these is a `Promise.race` per iterator.next()
// against a deadline — a bare `for await` + setTimeout(.return()) cannot
// interrupt an already-pending next() on a hung provider (this is what caused a
// 134-second hang). See raceStreamWithDeadline() below.
