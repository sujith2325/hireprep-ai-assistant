// electron/llm/whatToAnswerRequestSnapshot.ts
//
// Audit findings #6 + #3 (full) + #9 (full): a single request-scoped, immutable
// snapshot minted ONCE at the start of IntelligenceEngine.runWhatShouldISay and
// threaded through the pipeline stages that would otherwise re-read live,
// mutable state at different points across `await` boundaries.
//
// WHY (finding #6 — the race this closes):
//   runWhatShouldISay reads the active mode at several points separated by real
//   awaits (intent classification, profile grounding, dynamic import, the stream
//   deadline race). ModesManager.getActiveModeInfo()/getActiveMode() are backed
//   by a DB read + invalidate-on-write cache, and the `modes:set-active` IPC
//   (which calls ModesManager.setActiveMode) runs synchronously on the same main
//   thread — so it can flip the active mode WHILE this request is parked at an
//   await. The answer planner (mode prior → answerType → context route) would
//   then disagree with the prompt suffix / pinned instructions / reference
//   retrieval that WhatToAnswerLLM re-reads from the live singleton later in the
//   SAME request → a mismatched contract vs. prompt for one answer.
//
//   The fix is the standard request-scoped read: capture the mode ONCE at t0 and
//   pass the snapshot to every stage that previously re-read. When no mid-request
//   switch happens the snapshot is byte-identical to what the live reads would
//   return, so behavior is unchanged in the common case.
//
// WHY (finding #3 — live token supersession id):
//   The snapshot carries the request's `generationId`, which is stamped onto the
//   `suggested_answer_token` → `intelligence-token-batch` payload so the renderer
//   can drop batches belonging to a superseded live answer (engine-side
//   supersession already blocks most emits; this is renderer-side defense-in-depth
//   for the already-queued-batch window).
//
// WHY (finding #9 — joinable telemetry):
//   The snapshot carries the `requestId` (shared with the PiLatencyTrace) plus
//   sessionId / meetingId / surface / modeId so the engine's IntelligenceTrace can
//   be correlated with the latency trace and joined across IPC → engine →
//   provider. IDS / MARKERS ONLY — never raw transcript / prompt / profile /
//   question content.
//
// This module is intentionally a tiny plain data carrier (NOT a framework / god
// object). It is pure and dependency-light so it can be unit-tested directly.
