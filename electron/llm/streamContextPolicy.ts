// D1 fix (PROFILE_INTELLIGENCE_RESEARCH_AND_REDESIGN.md §15 R1): make the
// deterministic routing decision AUTHORITATIVE at the central execution
// choke-point (LLMHelper._streamChatInner).
//
// The spec (§4) requires the Profile Intelligence Router to run before final
// prompt assembly and the model to receive ONLY the context the answer type
// allows. Today the two in-stream injection sites in _streamChatInner —
//   (1) the knowledge-mode intercept (injects the user's profile contextBlock),
//   (2) the active-mode injection (retrieves the mode's custom context),
// never see the AnswerPlan, so exclusion depends entirely on each *caller*
// remembering to set the ignoreKnowledgeMode/skipModeInjection booleans, and the
// mode-injection site passes a HARDCODED 'general_meeting_answer' answer type
// that defeats the custom-context sensitivity scoping for every other answer
// type.
//
// This module is the single, pure, testable policy the execution path consults.
// No LLM, no I/O.
