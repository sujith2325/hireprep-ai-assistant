//
// MODE-AWARE ROUTING PRIOR (Profile Intelligence v3, W1).
//
// The active ModesManager mode ("sales", "lecture", "technical-interview", …)
// is a strong PRIOR on what an AMBIGUOUS turn is about: an unmatched question
// in a sales call is almost certainly a sales question, not a meeting recap.
// Until now `planAnswer` was mode-blind — every fallthrough landed on
// unknown_answer / general_meeting_answer regardless of the live setting, which
// is exactly the "doesn't answer / answers generically" failure mode.
//
// DESIGN RULE (leak-safety invariant): the mode is a prior, NEVER an override.
// Explicit answer-type signals (coding verbs, negotiation words, identity asks,
// profile probes, …) always win — this module is consulted ONLY on the final
// classification fallthrough, after every explicit pattern has had its chance.
// Redirecting the fallthrough TYPE is the whole mechanism: the per-type
// required/forbidden layer tables in AnswerPlanner then apply automatically
// (sales_answer already forbids resume/jd/negotiation, lecture_answer already
// requires reference_files, …), so no layer rule is ever relaxed here.
//
// Pure data + pure functions. No I/O, no LLM, no imports with side effects —
// trivially testable and safe on the hot path.
