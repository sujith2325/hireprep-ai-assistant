// scaffold-misfire shapes, live repros A4/A5/C9 proved the model invents
// heading text (e.g. "## STAR story, Long-Tail aggregation at Datadog") that

// extraction returns null even though the coding-scaffold fingerprint
// (Technique/Dry Run heading or O(...)/complexity notation) proves real
// contamination. hasUnrecoveredScaffoldContamination is a detection-only

    const raw = `## Approach
- I want to land on a clear, structured answer that pulls directly from your Stripe work on the streaming reconciliation system, since that is the most defensible "recent impact" story.
- The framing should be tight: pick one project, own it end-to-end, then add one or two sharp metrics that prove scale.
- I will stay in your voice and avoid coaching wrappers.

## STAR Story, Streaming Reconciliation at Stripe
- **Situation:** I was the tech lead on Stripe's payment reconciliation. The legacy pipeline was a nightly Hadoop batch job that took 14 hours to close the books and was the single biggest source of finance-team escalations.
- **Task:** Replace it with a streaming pipeline that could keep the ledger in sync with the payments surface in near real time.
- **Action:**
  - Designed a Kafka-based ingestion layer with exactly-once semantics into Flink, using idempotent sinks backed by DynamoDB conditional writes so replays were safe.

## Technique / Data Structure / Algorithm Used
- Kafka exactly-once ingestion, Flink stream processing, DynamoDB conditional writes for idempotency.`;

- Stay in your Datadog voice; the interviewer is testing whether you can speak crisply about a system you actually owned, not the Stripe story.

## STAR story, Long-Tail aggregation at Datadog
- **Situation:** I owned the tail-aggregation service on the Long-Tail team at Datadog.
- **Result:** Cut tail-merge latency substantially and let us onboard customers we previously had to throttle.

## Interviewer follow-ups to expect
- How you picked the sharding key and what happens during resharding.

## Technique / Data Structure / Algorithm Used
- Consistent hashing for shard placement, RocksDB LSM as the per-shard store, bloom filters on the read path.

## Complexity
- Sharded reads and writes are O(1) network hops plus O(log n) LSM cost per shard.`;

Design a deterministic, replay-safe, multi-region reconciliation pipeline: stream ledger entries through Kafka, aggregate and deduplicate in a streaming engine keyed by transaction id.
