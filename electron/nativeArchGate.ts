/**
 * NATIVE-ARCH BOOT GATE — module-load-time arch verification.
 *
 * Refuses to launch if better-sqlite3 / keytar were built for a different
 * architecture than this hardware. Without this gate, a Rosetta-poisoned
 * `.node` (x86_64 on arm64) fails at first dlopen inside DatabaseManager's
 * `import Database from 'better-sqlite3'` — which fires at module-load time,
 * well before app.whenReady() can run any async gate.
 *
 * The gate must run BEFORE the ESM imports in main.ts can pull in
 * DatabaseManager. Two facts make this tricky:
 *
 *   1. esbuild hoists all `import` statements to the top of the bundled
 *      `__esm` body in SOURCE ORDER. The first `import` in main.ts triggers
 *      the first `init_*()` call inside init_main() at module-load.
 *
 *   2. `import Database from 'better-sqlite3'` inside DatabaseManager.ts
 *      is a side-effect import that runs `require("better-sqlite3")` the
 *      first time DatabaseManager is referenced. That happens via
 *      `init_ipcHandlers()` (because ipcHandlers.ts imports DatabaseManager),
 *      which is itself the first non-trivial `init_*()` in main.ts.
 *
 * To win the race, main.ts does `import './nativeArchGate'` as its FIRST
 * import. esbuild emits `init_nativeArchGate()` before `init_ipcHandlers()`
 * inside the bundled init_main(), so this module's IIFE runs first.
 *
 * On mismatch: throws synchronously. The uncaughtException handler in
 * main.ts renders the dialog and exits with code 1. We do NOT call
 * process.exit() here because the user hasn't seen the dialog yet —
 * process.exit() races with showErrorBox's modal rendering. Throwing
 * synchronously prevents any subsequent require() in the same module-load
 * from running, which includes the one that would otherwise dlopen
 * better-sqlite3.

  // permanently locks the user out of boot with no in-app recovery. A
  // packaging or `file`-classification regression is exactly the kind of
  // thing that has bricked a shipped build before. NATIVELY_SKIP_ARCH_GATE=1
  // disables the gate entirely so a false positive can never trap a user;
  // worst case without the gate is a clear dlopen error later, not a silent
