//
// Phase 3 (context-rebuild) live-repro test for docs/context-rebuild
// hypothesis #4 (00_BASELINE_AND_REPRODUCTION.md §3.6 "doubled question text
// artifact"): a client-side STT final/partial race in
// src/components/NativelyInterface.tsx (the voice-dictation "Answer Now"
// flow) produced the observed doubled-question artifact:
//
//   "What is a race condition? Show howWhat is a race condition? Show how
//   you would diagnose and prevent one in a concurrent backend service. you
//   would diagnose and prevent one in a concurrent backend service."
//   (NATIVELY_CONTEXT_SYSTEM_SIMPLIFICATION_PROMPT.md line 2521; the
//   duplication is confirmed to have happened BEFORE the model saw it,
//   because [SOURCE-ARBITER]'s own `questionSnippet` at line 1372 already
//   shows the same duplicated text — i.e. it's a client-side
//   input-construction artifact, not a model artifact.)
//
// Phase 6 Slice 0 item 2 fix: the two accumulation sites
// (NativelyInterface.tsx's onNativeAudioTranscript final-event handler and
// handleAnswerNow's submit-time join) now both call the SAME shared,
// overlap-aware merge helper — src/lib/transcriptMerge.mjs's
// mergeTranscriptChunks — instead of duplicating its arithmetic. This file
// therefore imports and exercises the REAL production module (no verbatim
// copy), unlike the pre-fix version of this file.
//
// Finding on the "both renderer flows" question (03_LIVE_REPRO_FINDINGS.md
// item 4's "bonus finding" that handleAnswerNow and handleManualSubmit both
// tag `surface: 'manual_chat'` on the same IPC channel): handleManualSubmit
// is driven entirely by `inputValue` (typed-input React state) and never
// reads `voiceInputRef`/`manualTranscriptRef` — confirmed by reading
// NativelyInterface.tsx's handleManualSubmit in full. It already has its own,
// separate exact-duplicate-resubmission guard (shouldDedupeManualSubmit,
// src/lib/overlaySubmitDedup.mjs), which addresses a different failure mode
// (re-submitting the identical text twice within a time window), not
// overlapping-STT-chunk merging. So this specific race is NOT shared across
// both renderer flows: handleManualSubmit has zero exposure to it. This is a
// finding, not a gap in this fix's coverage.
